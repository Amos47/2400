Chapter 4 considers the corporate side of the ICT domain, considering competitive advantage, Porter's 5 Forces and Productivity Frontier followed by the critical topic of Strategy and strategic alignment. We then take a fairly deep dive into Corporate Governance and how decision are made regarding ICT.

We end the chapter with an in-depth look at the big picture of the organisation, encompassing the related and overlapping topics of levels of management, system types, decision making, complexity of data and the relative importance of humans versus technology as it relates to each of these domains. This is an important section in an important chapter. Pay attention here.
