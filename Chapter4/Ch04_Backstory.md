###Is your IT operating at two speeds?

It’s hard—perhaps impossible—to undergo a digital transformation with a legacy IT architecture. While the integrity of transaction-focused systems with sensitive data must be protected, IT needs to build out a separate system that can provide nimble customer-facing capabilities. New apps and databases can then be added as needed without touching the underlying systems that run the rest of the business. This second high-speed system supports agile development and prototyping, with weekly or even daily releases and an experimental “fail faster” mind-set.3

In developing high-speed systems, digital leaders put in place the analytics and intelligence needed to provide near-real-time insights into customer needs and behaviors, which then determine the personalized messages and offers delivered to individual customers. Being digital involves establishing a cyclical dynamic in which processes and capabilities are constantly evolving in response to inputs from the customer.4 Supporting this give-and-take process across multiple platforms at scale requires extensive automation.
