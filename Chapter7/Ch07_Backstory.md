Interesting to note that this textbook was written primarily using an open-source tool called *GitBook* which rests on the *GitHub* infrastructure mentioned in the ad. It's a small world...  

### How the internet works (a very brief introduction)

The internet is a *network of networks*. In any organisation, large or small, there are likely multiple devices capable of communication with each other. Think desktops, laptops, smart devices, tablets, printers, modems and a wide variety of smaller devices such as sensors and beacons. But how does this communication take place? Let's start at the very beginning, with the original switched network, the telephone system.  

####Circuit Switching
In the old days, every telephone was connected to every other telephone by wire. They weren't all simultaneously connected mind you. BUt if you had a phone, it was physically connected to the phone company network. If when you wanted to make a call from phone number 5 to number 7, you requested the assistance of an operator - by either spinning an arm on the phone or clicking the receiver cradle to send a request signal on the line. The operator would connect with your line and ask you which number you wanted to reach. The operator would them *physically* connect your line with the destination line by plugging a wire into a large what was called *switchboard*. When the call ended, the operator disconnected the lines. Much of this was automated in the 1950s and onward, where mechanical switches were used to *disintermediate* operators. They were all out of work, and 95% (my estimate) were women. There were still *long distance* operators into the 1970s. Long distance calls were initiated by dialing the number "0" and asking for a long distance operator. Here, different networks were connected together and you could hear the operators talking to each other. "Hello 312? This is 416 long distance operator requesting local number..." and so on. It was fun to listen. The numbers 312 and 416 were, of course, the Area Codes (AC) of Chicago and Toronto, respectively. An interesting tidbit is that, when area codes were assigned in North America in the late 1940s, states and provinces with only one AC were given numbers with a "0" in the middle, and those with more than one AC were assigned numbers with a "1" in the middle. So Illinois and Ontario had more than one AC. Furthermore, the numbers were assigned based on population, with the smallest numerical sums going to more densely populated areas. This was to reduce wear and tear on the equipment as when a number was dialed (when direct dialing was introduced), the phone had a rotary dial. The dial had to be spun around to indicate the number, and the actual physical clicking you heard was a signal to the network of the number you were dialing. It would count the clicks. There would obviously be more calls going to larger population areas, thus there was an effort to reduce the number of clicks required. This is totally useless information, but it might come in handy some day in a game of trivia.

####IP Addresses
Everything that is connects to the internet has an *Internet Protocol address*, usually referred to simply as an IP address or just an IP. Originally, I{P addresses were made up of 4, 3-digit numbers separated by a dot. The form was xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Many devices still use this standard, called IPv4. The newer standard (IPv4 addresses were running out by 1995) is IPv6 (v5 is never mentioned - maybe it was that incident at the wedding reception last year?). The format of IPv^ addresses is considerably longer. Our friends at Wikipedia have this to say:

>"The rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The permanent solution was deemed to be a redesign of the Internet Protocol itself. This new generation of the Internet Protocol was eventually named Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) in 1995. The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bits (16 octets), thus providing up to 2128 (approximately 3.403×1038) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future."

[Interested?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)

Just to reiterate: every device both great and small, if it's connected to the internet, has an IP address, either v4 or v6. That's how devices on the network communicate. Every communication across the net must be addressed to some other device, otherwise, why bother communicating? Devices would simply be whistling in the wind with no one to hear the tune. That's fine for humans, but we expect more from our machines. 

####DNS - Domain Name Servers
At very low levels, when machines are talking to machines, they use IP address exclusively. But if we tpe the address *www.carleton.ca* into a browser, how does it get the address of the web server at Carleton? When we type that address into the browser's address box, we're asking to contact a web server at the school and for it to send back to our machine the home page for Carleton. But we're not typing an IP address, but a name. This is where Domain Name Servers come in. DNS' hold tables of IP addresses with associated names (like *carleton.ca*) and when a request is made over the World Wide Web service, the DNS does the translation of the name we type to the machine's IP address. Simple.

The internet as the telephone lines or highways

**Table YTDS. Internet Protocols**

| Protocol Layer | Description |
| :-: | :- |
| Applications Protocol Layer | Protocols specific to particular applications which use the Internet. For example: the World-Wide Web (WWW), email (Post Office Protocol - POP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Voice over IP (VOIP), etc.|
| Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Layer | TCP directs packets to a specific application on a computer using a port number. |
| Internet Protocol (IP) Layer | IP directs packets to a specific computer using an IP address. |
| Hardware Layer | Converts binary packet data to network signals and back. For example: Ethernet network card, modem for phone lines, WiFi adapter, etc.)

**Figure TBRT. Network Protocols and Communication**

![Protocols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/protocols.png)

The (somewhat dated but still quite valid) Stanford University article explains what's going on in Figure TBRT (edited for context and clarity):

1. Let's imagine that you want to send an email from your computer on the left, with an IP address of 1.2.3.4, to computer 5.6.7.8 on the right. The user types the message ("Hello computer 5.6.7.8!") into an email client (the application on the top layer) to start the process.  
2. If the message to be sent is long, each stack layer that the message passes through may break the message up into smaller chunks of data. This is because data sent over the Internet (and most computer networks) are sent in manageable chunks. On the Internet, these chunks of data are known as *packets*.
3. The packets are passed on by the Application Layer and continue to the TCP layer. Here, each packet is assigned a *port number*. Ports will be explained later, but suffice to say that many programs may be using the TCP/IP stack (at the same time) and sending messages. We need to know which program on the destination computer needs to receive the message because it will be listening on a specific port, thus we need to send to that port. One of the jobs of the TCP layer is to include the port number in the contents of each packet it passes to the IP layer below it. 
4. The packets now proceed down to the IP layer. This is where each packet receives it's destination address, in this case the IP number *5.6.7.8.* It is important to note also that sequencing information is also added to the packets so that they can be reassembled in the proper sequence on the destination machine. We don't want our message to come out as "8pHll7..rc" etc. (These are some of the characters in the original message, but in the wrong order.) 
5. Now that our message packets have a port number and an IP address and a sequence number, they are ready to be sent over the Internet. The hardware layer takes care of turning our packets containing the alphabetic text of our message into electronic signals and transmitting them over the internet.
6. On the other end of the modem in your home, your ISP has a direct connection to the Internet. The ISPs router examines the destination address in each packet and determines where to send it. Often, the packet's next stop is another router. The message zips around from router to router, following the least busy electronic pathway, until all pieces are received at the destination computer. 
7. Eventually, the packets reach computer 5.6.7.8. Here, the packets start at the bottom of the destination computer's TCP/IP stack and work upwards.
8. As the packets go upwards through the stack, all routing data that the sending computer's stack added (such as IP address, port number and sequence) is stripped from the packets.
9. When the data reaches the top of the stack, the packets have been re-assembled into their original form, "Hello computer 5.6.7.8!" appears as an email in the destination computer.
