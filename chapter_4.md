# Chapter 4

The public side of things

In which we discuss strategy, Porter, value chain, IT decision making models, corporate governance (see business dictionary definitions such as:

Plus all the stuff from Module 1 (etc.)

From Module 2:
IS should not be used as a cure-all for organizational problems. Even today, with the knowledge of best practices, project management, and information systems, failures in the implementation of such critical systems like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) still occur. In many cases, we cannot blame these failures on technology. The key to developing a good strategy to achieve an organization’s goals is to buy, rent or build but at any rate, have build well-designed and well-managed systems available.

Also Module 2:

IT is a crucial part of an organization’s assets. It must be managed like any other asset, through governance and planning. This means that the business impact of IT investments must be as measureable and compelling as any other business case. Strategically, CIOs must justify IT spending and show return the same as any other strategic investment. Competitive advantages because of information technology are no longer sustainable advantages [what does this mean and why is it important?, therefore IT is granted no special dispensation when it comes to budget, capital or other strategic investments.
Using our simple test of whether or not there is less input... think here. 

Ensuring alignment of IS strategy and business strategy
Because of the pervasiveness and importance of IS in the business environment, it is imperative for businesses to ensure that their IS strategies are aligned with and adequately reflect their overall business strategy. If these strategies are misaligned, an organization’s ability to meet its goals and objectives can be severely jeopardized. For example, given the significant percentage of capital investment represented by IT assets, it is critical that these assets, and the systems they support, fit with the objectives and strategies of the business as a whole. The business/IS strategic alignment in the example (increase sales by 10% aligned with a reduction in backup/archive/recovery costs resulting in increased system availability) works because the goal of increased sales as a key business strategy is supported by backup initiative of IS. 

IT Decision making structures (EDIT THIS)
Among the most common decision-making structures are:
• executive or senior management committees which provide ongoing business leadership and involvement in IT—often referred to as an IT steering committee
• IT leadership committees composed of senior IT leaders from different areas of IT, such as infrastructure and development
• process teams made up of IT members and business/IT relationship managers
• IT councils composed of business and IT executives
• architecture committees
• capital approval committees

Of these, CIOs rate IT leadership committees and business/IT relationship managers as the most effective means of ensuring adequate decision making. In both cases IT expertise is matched with business knowledge so that decisions are more comprehensive than departmental.
