#### Social Media (SM)

Given that we (you and I but likely much more you than I) spend a lot (see below) of time on social media, maybe it's high time we took a look at how much return we're getting on it. 

Let's start buy quantifying, by example, what I mean by the term *social media*. According to <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-networking-websites" target="_blank">ebizmedia.com</a>, the top 15 most popular social media sites in October 2016 were:

1. Facebook (by far!)
2. YouTube
3. Twitter
4. LinkedIn
5. Pinterest
6. Google+
7. Tumblr
8. Instagram
9. reddit
10. VK
11. Flickr
12. Vine
13. meetup
14. ask.fm
15. ClassMates 

And not a Snapchat among them. Interesting eh? 

Now let's look at some statistics on SM usage. Despite some really glaring thinko/typo errors in this infographic, it has an interesting story to tell.

 JOURNALISTS: Why do you use social media? http://mashable.com/2009/12/02/personal-social-media-roi/#1ivkIKzAEkqK

Why do people use SM? http://www.onepoll.com/10-reasons-people-use-social-media/

Despite the fact that the survey link is broken, this is an interesting place to start:

>"A recent study [link broken] by Whiting and Williams interviewed a range of social media users and explored what keeps them coming back to social networks. [They found that people use SM for the following reasons (I assume not in any particular order.) I have added some editorial comment following each reason, to which we will later refer.]

>Social interaction – social media, not surprisingly, allows people to be social. They meet new people and keep in touch with friends, acquaintances and family. [People are social animals - we need social interaction or at least *most* of us do - in order to validate our existence. SM provides such contact, albeit not very *rich* contact. Physical touch is essential.]
>
Information seeking – this refers to the process of finding information about products/services, keeping up to date with real-world social events, and learning new things. [Humans are innately curious about our surroundings. We have survived through the millennia by being constantly aware of what is in our surroundings and what is friend and what is foe.]
>
Passing time – social media is a great time killer and can cure boredom whether at home, at school, or in the work place. [See later stats about just how much of our online time at work is actually work!]
>
Entertainment – games, music and videos are all accessed through social media. Watching the stream of updates from people is also a form of entertainment – whether intentionally humorous or not. [We all need a break from time to time. essentially the same as Passing time (above) and Relaxation (below).]
>
Relaxation – whilst people find others updates humorous, they also find them relaxing. Social media is a way to alleviate stress and escape from reality. [I'm not so sure this is any different from Entertainment...]
>
Expression of opinions – expressing thoughts and opinions, criticizing others and blowing off steam (either anonymously or named) is regularly undertaken through social media. [But trolling is a nasty business.]
>
Things to talk about – like the daily newspaper, social media provide subject matter for people to talk and gossip about with others. [This is information seeking so doesn't merit a separate category.]
>
Convenience – social media is readily accessible, even more so as mobile devices become ubiquitous. Furthermore, people can talk to several people at the same time. [Convenience is not a human need as far as I understand. We like to be efficient, sometimes... The second part about multi-channel is valid but this is simply Sharing information (below) and Social interaction (above).]
>
Sharing information – people can use social media to broadcast things about themselves. By publishing updates, videos and pictures, people market their own personal brand or business. [The marketing part I agree with, but the broadcasting is too similar to expressing of opinions to warrant specific mention here.] 
>
Knowing about others – social media allows a window into the lives of others. By checking out other profiles, they can be nosey or ‘keep up with the Jones’’. [Way too similar to Information seeking and Social interaction.]"

So let's boil that down to what I think are the main reasons people use SM. Here's my list:

- Social interaction
- Data seeking and sharing
- Diversion (entertainment, passing time and relaxation)
- Marketing one's personal brand

Thus there's nothing *particularly special* about social media as opposed to other forms of human interaction. We use SM in much the same way we have used newspapers, libraries, movie theatres, radio and TV in the past. But what *is* different is the ability SM gives us to reach out to a wide audience, and to receive from a wide variety of sources, both in real time. This *marketing of personal brand* is unprecedented in history. We do need to ask though, with everyone doing personal marketing on such a grand scale, is there enough time to listen?

In this regard, I'm reminded of research by British Anthropologist Robin Dunbar, discussed by Malcolm Gladwell in his iconic year 2000 book *The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference* (Back Bay Books). Gladwell reports on Dunbar's findings that, all through history, humans have kept their optimal social group size surprisingly constant as around 150. Dunbar's research demonstrates that it is the size of the human neocortex (a region of the brain) that dictates the maximum number of *relationships* both direct and between the others in the group. This 150 figure is remarkably consistent across all manner of social groups (including military) over recorded history. Our little brain just can't handle any more complexity than that. The social fabric begins to unravel when numbers in a group get too far beyond this optimal number.  

So we need to ask. Are we expanding our network by using SM? Or are we simply either spreading ourselves thinner? Or are we expanding our network by at the expense of the quality of our closest relationships? The *platform* keeps track of much of what we would otherwise need to process in our little brains so we can scroll back through our timeline to see what was happening last week or last month or last year. We are freed from having to keep in our own memory. This allows us to artificially extend our network beyond the 150 mark.

Interested in Dunbar's Number? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number

But let me share something with you. I have as of October 25, 2016, 1,592 connections in my LinkedIn network. And I ask myself "Why?" I spend some part of nearly every day simply maintaining that network, saying congrats on the new job or approving (or more likely rejecting) new requests for inclusion in my *exclusive network* of close associates. I recently approved a request from an HR Project Coordinator at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. And I don't know why. I took the time to examine her profile and to check our common connections and then said yes to her request. But I'm not sure what it gives me at this point in my career. I'm not going to change jobs and we have little or nothing in common (except my background in Epidemiology I suppose) that would lead to a synergistic relationship. We'll return to this shortly.  

The other side of this is the hit on the quality of our *physical* interactions. We maintain these artificially-outsized networks in an increasingly insular way.

Including:

- We’re usually invited to participate by people we know and trust.
- There are specific things we want to do with the other people involved, such as share photos, stay up-to-date on a club’s activities, or develop a personal reputation.
- We get something back from participation: advice, practical information we need, a network to tap when times are rough, or the emotional pleasure of seeing others photos or hearing their news.
- We have control over who sees our information.
- The applications are intuitive — there’s no training required.
- The applications are well-tuned to support the specific tasks we want to perform and their features are regularly rated and refined.
- 
There's no reason not to use the same metrics that firms use to measure their ROI on the effort expended on getting their message out there. So let's use some standard tools and see what your personal ROI on social media is. 

Step - 1: Define social media. We will define social media as any technology tool that allows you to send or receive messages regarding personal brand to and from one or more members of your relevant social network of family and either existing or *potential* friends, contacts, employers, lovers or haters.

Step 2: A simple definition of ROI:

ROI = (return – investment) / investment 

Step - 3: Define investment. For personal users of social media, those who aren't *selling something* in the commercial sense, the investment we make in social media can only be measured in *time*. How many minutes we spend in a defined time period engaging in social media activities. Those minutes are your investment. Your resource spend.

Step 4 - define "return". What does it mean in terms of your personal efforts? What do you want/expect to achieve by spending time on social media? What's a return on using Facebook, for example? What's the return on a tweet? For marketing or sales firms, those answers are a little easier (though not much) to nail down. A new *follower*? A re-tweet? A product brochure download? A sale? Some of these are more concrete than others, but there's a progression, culminating in the ultimate for a business: revenue. 

We need also to determine what your goals are for using SM. What do you expect to achieve? http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/measure-social-media-roi/

<a class="underlined-link" href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/measure-social-media-roi-business/" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a> has this to say about measuring the value of a social media programme for business:

>"Measuring your social media ROI is important for countless reasons, including, but not limited to: 
>
- Proving the value of social media to your organization’s overall goals and business objectives
- Allowing you to clearly see where efforts and resources are being used efficiently
- Enabling you to evaluate where resources are being wasted, or not used as efficiently as possible
- Allowing you to recognize gaps in strategy, key messages, and content
- Showing where your social media budget is being used most effectively, and showing areas where it can be pulled back"

Let's look at these from a personal perspective, one by one. 

How would you, personally, go about the task of proving the value of social media to your overall objectives?

### Machine Learning

Traditionally, the only way to get a computer to do something— from adding two numbers to flying an airplane— was to write down an algorithm explaining how, in painstaking detail. But machine-learning algorithms, also known as learners, are different: they figure it out on their own, by making inferences from data. And the more data they have, the better they get. Now we don’t have to program computers; they program themselves.
