# Chapter 5 - The personal side of ICT

## What's in ICT for me?

Let's start with a gentle introduction to *the digital divide*. 

**Figure KSRT. The digital divide**

The Digital Divide refers to the gap between the *haves* and the *have nots* in terms of access to the internet and modern computing. This gap can occur at any level from neighbourhoods in a community all the way up to nations at the global level. Those with access to modern computing tools and techniques have a distinct advantage over those without such access. Things as basic as the ability to create and print or send an digital resume, access to online job postings, access to critical health information, the ability to upgrade one's skills through online education, among many others, are out of reach for those with no digital access. Imagine your world without the internet.

Figure KSRT shows the trends over time in internet usage for developed versus developing countries from 1999 to 2014 (estimated). The figure also provides the ratio of developed to developing countries in the internet figures. The most striking change over time is the decline in the ratio over time. This becomes less striking when you examine the starting values for the ratio. Already by 1999, the internet was popular in developed countries with 24% penetration as opposed to 1% in developing countries. Thus the ratio was 24:1. Even moderate growth in both areas would yield a declining ratio, as evidenced by 2001, where the developed world had increased usage from 24 to 36 (a 50% increase) but the developing world increased from 1 to 3 (a 300% increase - 6 times faster than the developed world increase) over the same time. The ratio is steadily dropping, and sat at 2.4:1 in 2014. But the disparity remains stark: the rate of increase in usage in the two regions has been roughly the same for the last 10 years or so, but still, 78% of the inhabitants of developed countries use the internet compared to only 32% of those in developing countries. To be truly equitable, the gap needs to close.

This is important for you since, in my experience, I've found that younger people when making marketing or strategic plans, tend to take it for granted that everyone is just like them and: 1) has access to internet resources; 2) knows how to use them; 3) *wants* to use them and; 4) does not take privacy very seriously. These are all dangerous assumptions.
