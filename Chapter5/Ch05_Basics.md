## The personal side of ICT - What's in ICT for me?

####Productivity

Has technology made us more productive? http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2016/08/10/are-we-more-productive/

#### Social Media
Let's quantify by example what I mean by the term *social media*. According to <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-networking-websites" target="_blank">ebizmedia.com</a>, the top 15 most popular social media sites in October 2016 were:

1. Facebook
2. YouTube
3. Twitter
4. LinkedIn
5. Pinterest
6. Google+
7. Tumblr
8. Instagram
9. reddit
10. VK
11. Flickr
12. Vine
13. meetup
14. ask.fm
15. ClassMates 

And not a Snapchat among them. Interesting eh? 


Why do you use social media? http://mashable.com/2009/12/02/personal-social-media-roi/#1ivkIKzAEkqK

Why do people use SM? http://www.onepoll.com/10-reasons-people-use-social-media/

Despite the fact that the survey link is broken, this is an interesting place to start:

A recent study by Whiting and Williams interviewed a range of social media users and explored what keeps them coming back to social networks.

Social interaction – social media, not surprisingly, allows people to be social. They meet new people and keep in touch with friends, acquaintances and family.
Information seeking – this refers to the process of finding information about products/services, keeping up to date with real-world social events, and learning new things.
Passing time – social media is a great time killer and can cure boredom whether at home, at school, or in the work place.
Entertainment – games, music and videos are all accessed through social media. Watching the stream of updates from people is also a form of entertainment – whether intentionally humorous or not.
Relaxation – whilst people find others updates humorous, they also find them relaxing. Social media is a way to alleviate stress and escape from reality.
Expression of opinions – expressing thoughts and opinions, criticizing others and blowing off steam (either anonymously or named) is regularly undertaken through social media.
Things to talk about – like the daily newspaper, social media provide subject matter for people to talk and gossip about with others.
Convenience – social media is readily accessible, even more so as mobile devices become ubiquitous. Furthermore, people can talk to several people at the same time.
Sharing information – people can use social media to broadcast things about themselves. By publishing updates, videos and pictures, people market their own personal brand or business.
Knowing about others – social media allows a window into the lives of others. By checking out other profiles, they can be nosey or ‘keep up with the Jones’’.

Including:

- We’re usually invited to participate by people we know and trust.
- There are specific things we want to do with the other people involved, such as share photos, stay up-to-date on a club’s activities, or develop a personal reputation.
- We get something back from participation: advice, practical information we need, a network to tap when times are rough, or the emotional pleasure of seeing others photos or hearing their news.
- We have control over who sees our information.
- The applications are intuitive — there’s no training required.
- The applications are well-tuned to support the specific tasks we want to perform and their features are regularly rated and refined.
- 
There's no reason not to use the same metrics that firms use to measure their ROI on the effort expended on getting their message out there. So let's use some standard tools and see what your personal ROI on social media is. 

Step - 1: Define social media. We will define social media as any technology tool that allows you to send or receive messages regarding personal brand to and from one or more members of your relevant social network of family and either existing or *potential* friends, contacts, employers, lovers or haters.

Step 2: A simple definition of ROI:

ROI = (return – investment) / investment 

Step - 3: Define investment. For personal users of social media, those who aren't *selling something* in the commercial sense, the investment we make in social media can only be measured in *time*. How many minutes we spend in a defined time period engaging in social media activities. Those minutes are your investment. Your resource spend.

Step 4 - define "return". What does it mean in terms of your personal efforts? What do you want/expect to achieve by spending time on social media? What's a return on using Facebook, for example? What's the return on a tweet? For marketing or sales firms, those answers are a little easier (though not much) to nail down. A new *follower*? A re-tweet? A product brochure download? A sale? Some of these are more concrete than others, but there's a progression, culminating in the ultimate for a business: revenue. 

We need also to determine what your goals are for using SM. What do you expect to achieve? http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/measure-social-media-roi/

<a class="underlined-link" href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/measure-social-media-roi-business/" target="_blank">Hootsuite </a> has this to say about measuring the value of a social media programme for business:

>"Measuring your social media ROI is important for countless reasons, including, but not limited to: 
>
- Proving the value of social media to your organization’s overall goals and business objectives
- Allowing you to clearly see where efforts and resources are being used efficiently
- Enabling you to evaluate where resources are being wasted, or not used as efficiently as possible
- Allowing you to recognize gaps in strategy, key messages, and content
- Showing where your social media budget is being used most effectively, and showing areas where it can be pulled back"

Let's look at these from a personal perspective, one by one. 

How would you, personally, go about the task of proving the value of social media to your overall objectives?

### Machine Learning

Traditionally, the only way to get a computer to do something— from adding two numbers to flying an airplane— was to write down an algorithm explaining how, in painstaking detail. But machine-learning algorithms, also known as learners, are different: they figure it out on their own, by making inferences from data. And the more data they have, the better they get. Now we don’t have to program computers; they program themselves.
