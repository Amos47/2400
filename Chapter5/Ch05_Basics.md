## What's in ICT for me?

Let's start with a gentle introduction to *the digital divide*.

The Digital Divide refers to the gap between the *haves* and the *have nots* in terms of access to the internet and modern computing. This gap can occur at any level from neighbourhoods in a community all the way up to nations at the global level. Those with access to modern computing tools and techniques have a distinct advantage over those without such access; things as basic as the ability to create and print or send an digital resume, access to online job postings; access to critical health information, the ability to upgrade one's skills through online education, among many others. 

Figure KSRT shows the trends over time in internet usage for developed versus developing countries from 1999 to 2014 (estimated). THe figure also provides the ratio of developed to developing countries in the internet figures.
