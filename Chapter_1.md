### What is technology?

Wikipedia offers that Technology is "...the collection of tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures used by humans." Note the breadth of this definition. How do we understand *tools* in this context, for example? It is not inconceivable that a tool could be a hammer, a cell phone, a traffic signal, a spoken language or even applied mathematics. So technology is broad indeed.

[Interested?](http://bit.ly/139Y25z)

The online [Business Dictionary](http://businessdictionary.com) also takes a broad view, and delineates categories and taxonomies. They write that technology is "The purposeful application of *information* in the design, production, and utilization of goods and services, and in the organization of human activities." (emphasis added)

<a name="tangible"></a>
#### Tangible versus intangible
Further, they provide the following detail, while splitting the taxonomy into two additive (presumably) sub-categories. Thus technology can be either tangible (can be touched, seen, etc.) or intangible (not physical -- as in the sense of services) (see also the more extensive treatment of this topic in the major Theme 2 section below). Further, they rank three levels of interaction between technology and the matter and forces with which it interacts. So we can have tangible technology that is either high, medium or low, with the same three levels for intangible. They write that: "Technology is generally divided into five categories [my explanations/examples in brackets]." The list begins with the distinction between tangible and intangible:

1. Tangible (blueprints, models, operating manuals, prototypes) [can be touched, take up space, etc.]
2. Intangible (consultancy, problem-solving, and training methods) [do not exist in the physical realm; do not exist until consumed...]

And then continues in term of *sophistication*:

1. High (entirely or almost entirely automated and intelligent technology that manipulates ever finer matter and ... powerful forces) [a space shuttle]
2. Intermediate (semi-automated partially intelligent technology that manipulates refined matter and medium level forces) [an eCommerce algorithm to suggest stuff for you to buy] 
3. Low (labour-intensive technology that manipulates only coarse or gross matter and weaker forces) [a shovel]"

[Interested?](http://bit.ly/1GsH5SO)

But the online Oxford Dictionary takes a much narrower view, *viz*.: "The application of scientific knowledge [the logical progeny of information] for practical purposes, especially in industry. [For example,] advances in computer technology [or] recycling technologies." 

We will take this narrower view of technology in this book, partly because we just don't have the time to consider all the nuances that the broader scope suggests. So when we consider technology, and specifically *information and communication technology*, we will be constraining ourselves to the narrow realm where engineering, science (both natural and social) and business realities intersect and interact with the systems that are in use in our modern society, with an eye to whether or not they are creating value by either reducing input or enhancing output.

### Information technology

What then of the overlap between information and technology? What exactly is it? Turns out it's a long story, stretching all the way back to prehistory. An excellent introduction is provided by a book in the openbookproject.

## Pillar 2: Is what we are examining a tangible or an intangible?

This distinction is larger and more important than the traditional one made in most introductory information system classes. We were wont to say that tangible things are those with a physical presence that we can touch, such as a computer or a smartphone. Intangible was something that, while it exists, cannot be weighed, measured or directly detected, such as software or a computer service such as email. You can weigh a smartphone, but how much does email weigh? What are its dimensions? If measurable at all, its measurement is in terms of counts, such as email sent and received, or a measure of quality such as delivery speed. 

While the traditional distinctions are still valid, it’s now bigger than that. Read on.

It started slowly, then picked up steam in the 1960s. What was *it*? It was the switch from the production of tangible goods (manufacturing) to intangible services (banking, health, education, etc.) in the post-industrial era, sometimes referred to as the era of *deindustrialisation*. Indeed the proportion of Canadians employed in the *secondary* sector (*primary* roughly being agriculture, mining and extraction, forestry, etc. and *tertiary* being the services sector) has declined steadily over time.  

**Figure AF. Proportion of Canadians employed in the secondary and tertiary industries, 1931 to 1975**

![Employment by sector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/employment_by_sector_31_75.PNG)

Examination of Figure AF shows some interesting trends. With the exception of the period during which Canada was at war (1939 – 1945), the proportion of Canadians of both sexes who were employed in the manufacturing sector has been in steady decline. On the other hand, there has been a steady rise, clearly since the inflection point at right around 1960, in jobs in what we call the *service or tertiary sector*. The trend lines in the graph clearly show the story. 

These trends have extended into the present day, where in 2014, using the percent of GDP generated by these sectors as an indicator, Policy Horizons Canada, using Statistics Canada data from 2011 and 2012, reported that activity in Manufacturing accounted for only 13% of Canada’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) while Service accounted for 72%. Natural resource extraction and Other, combined, account for the remaining 15%.  Indeed [Statistics Canada](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/labor10b-eng.htm) reported that in 2014, the number of employed Canadians in manufacturing had sunk to 9.6% (in 1975 it was over 20%) while the number in services has skyrocketed to 78.1%.

[Interested?](http://www.horizons.gc.ca/eng/content/significant-shifts-key-economic-sectors)

Here is what Policy Horizons had to say about it: *“The Canadian economy is dominated by the services industry, which makes up 72% of GDP and employs 78% of Canada's workforce. The services sector includes accommodation, business, cultural, education, financial, food, health care, information, professional, retail, transportation, wholesale and a range of other services. The sub-sectors that contribute the most to GDP include finance, insurance and real estate services (29% of total services), health care and social assistance (9.3%), retail trade (8.6%), public administration (8.2%) and wholesale trade (8%).”*

There are multiple reasons for these seismic shifts, but the nuances are best left to the labour economists and policy wonks. For our purposes, it matters not at all *why*, but rather only *that*. And it matters for the remainder of the so-called *advanced economies* as well (according to [World Bank data](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table) for 2013, Canada ranked 11th in terms of the size of our economy by GDP). All advanced economies have experienced the same relative shift over the same period (see the 1998 [IMF study](https://books.google.ca/books?id=-05vo38wz-IC&dq=advanced+economies+shift+from+manufacturing&source=gbs_navlinks_s)), and the economies of the currently modernising countries (China, India, Brazil, among others) will experience the same shift towards intangible, knowledge-based contribution to GDP. See the World Bank [study](http://bit.ly/1DQ2xNG).

But just as my eldest granddaughter Kiana loved to ask repeatedly when younger “But why grandpa?”, we ask why it matters that the world’s largest economies are increasingly dominated by service providers. 

The Policy Horizons (*ibid.*) piece has this to offer: *“Economic growth increasingly linked to intangibles: The shift from a goods economy to a knowledge economy has increased the importance of intangibles. Intangible assets include brand, customer base, design, human capital, intellectual property and [not physical but rather interpersonal and inter-organisational] networks, among others, which are all essential aspects driving firm value. Investments in intangible assets are an increasingly important source of growth that could result in a new range of business services. Also reshaping services is the rise of intangible artifacts through the digitization of information and arts. Freed from the resource constraints of physical production, the economics of these markets are being transformed by a shift from relative scarcity to relative abundance, suggesting a need for different pricing mechanisms. New monetization models are emerging, no longer centred on ownership but access, such as online subscriptions or the use of targeted advertising powered by data analytics. The greater ease of replicating intangible artifacts has also increased piracy and intellectual property concerns.”*

Careful reading of this passage reveals that we are firmly and irrevocably in what [Goldfinger](http://www.idate.fr/fic/revue_telech/68/goldfing.pdf) (accessed April 17, 2015) has termed *The Intangible Economy.* He writes: “Knowledge Economy, Digital Economy, Information Society, Experience Economy, names for the new economy proliferate to the point of becoming ubiquitous buzzwords.” Furthermore, in trying to describe the new economy, he offers “I would like to suggest an alternative framework, based on a single defining trend: the shift from tangible to intangible. The economic landscape of the present and future is no longer shaped by physical flows of material goods and products but by ethereal streams of data, images and symbols.” And finally “At the core of the agricultural economy, there was a relationship between man, nature and natural products. The core relationship of the industrial economy was between man, machine and machine-created artificial objects. The intangible economy is structured around relationships between man and ideas and symbols. The source of economic value and wealth is no longer the production of material goods but the creation and manipulation of intangible content. *We live in the intangible economy* [emphasis added].”

And of course by "man" the author meant "man and woman" when he (I assume) wrote this piece. Silly rabbit. 

Though the paper is a little dated (published in 2000), it remains valid today. A clever metric is reproduced below wherein the physical weight of certain commodities is expressed in terms of their cost in USD. It’s surprising.

**Figure LAJ. Comparison of price per pound for manufactured goods in different classes**

![Price per pound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/price_per_pound.PNG)

(Goldfinger quotes the source of this data as *Colvin, Fortune Magazine*, but does not provide the full citation in his paper. We’ll have to take it at face value.)

It’s indeed interesting to see that the pinnacle of costliness is still gold (in this limited comparison) but not far behind was the Intel P3 processor (the most powerful personal computer microprocessor at the time). Note also the relatively low cost per pound of the Mercedes in comparison to Viagra, for example. There’s plenty I could write about how gold, Mercedes and Viagra might work together (not to mention hot rolled steel) but I will spare you just this one time. 

What’s the point of this? It is to demonstrate the shift to what LSE professor Danny Quah (see the [Goldfinger article](http://www.idate.fr/fic/revue_telech/68/goldfing.pdf) for the reference) has called the *increasingly weightless economy* where more and more GDP is generated by “economic commodities that have little or no physical manifestations.” While this shift is not inherently due only to the so-called *digital revolution* it is also clear that much of the intangible output in this new economy is produced by or requires information and communication technology *to unlock its value*.

In case you were thinking that this is a strictly western, developed economy phenomenon, take a look at the infographic below from *The Globe and Mail* (Saturday, August 15, 2015 citing the World Bank as the data source) which accompanied an article entitled *China's New Economic Reality.*" Ignoring the image of the Chinese currency between the two lines, we clearly see that the red *services* line, separated by miles from the grey *industry* line in 1981, has recently crossed above the heavy industry contribution to China's GDP. The times they are a changing, indeed.

####Disassociation of content, time and support

We live in an increasingly digitised world. Consider a simple example: a hockey game. Time was, the only one way to enjoy the event was in person. Consider the myriad ways such an event can be enjoyed today, both *synchronously* (in real time both in person and offsite) and *asynchronously* (not in real time – stored for later consumption).  See Figure TT below.

**Figure TT. Disassociation of content, time and support**

![Disassociation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/disassociation.png)

Let’s unpack this busy figure. The event is a hockey game. In the early days of such games, they were played on local frozen ponds and then on makeshift rinks, and only when the temperature was below freezing. The teams were made up mostly of locals, and the fans, if there were such hardy souls, were locals rooting for the local boys (it was a man’s game back in the day). In order to experience the spectacle, it was necessary to attend in person. There wasn’t often any press to report on the match. The only artifacts produced by the games were in the memories of those in attendance, and any anecdotal scribblings of a local historian or scribe. Those were the days indeed.

As the cities and towns grew, so too did the rivalries. More and more attention was paid to sporting events and more archival material became available in the form of photographs and perhaps even some grainy film. Players began to receive small *rewards* for their efforts. Firms became interested in having their name associated with a winning side (as brand management). When real money enters the picture, interest picks up. More people attend the games. More widespread interest in the outcomes is aroused. This spiral of interest and investment leads to capacity problems at the arenas. Not enough seats for willing purchasers, and the widespread interest leads to the inability for *fans* to attend due to long travel times and cost.

Enter new support systems. The dawn of commercial radio, and then television, led to the ability for remote fans to enjoy at least some of the *in-person* experience of a sporting event in the comforts of their own home. This revolution required what Goldfinger calls *supports* and what we might think of as technology (which includes print media). Supports are the things that allow us to have a *near-real-time* experience of an event occurring in some other place. 

I remember back to the 1965-66 Junior “A” hockey season, the last where legendary Bobby Orr played for my hometown *Oshawa Generals*, and I was all of 13 years old. There was no TV coverage at all but I owned a gorgeous little compact transistor radio, powered by the very first 9-volt batteries, that I hid under my pillow so I could listen to the games as the Generals travelled to exotic (to me) locations around the country to beat first the *St. Catherine’s Black Hawks*, then the *Montréal Junior Canadiens* (at that time playing in the Ontario Hockey League) and finally the *Kitchener Rangers* to win the J. Ross Robertson trophy emblematic of OHA (not yet called the OHL) supremacy. The Oshawa side then went on to best the *North Bay Trappers* (by a combined score of 43-9 over four games) and finally the *Shawinigan Bruins* in three straight in a best-of-five to earn the right to represent the eastern provinces in the Memorial Cup.  

Oshawa lost to the *Edmonton Oil Kings* in that national final, with Orr playing hurt and finally reputedly being benched on orders from his new masters, the *Boston Bruins*, who had drafted and signed him to an NHL contract. Orr’s bad knees were legendary, even at 17 years of age. 

While the pain of losing that Memorial Cup series to the Oil Kings is still palpable, so is the sheer excitement of listening in near real-time as the games unfolded in faraway places. That little Japanese *Candle* transistor radio was my support. By the same token, I remember well watching the Toronto Maple Leafs (my dad’s team – I was a Bruin’s fan as Oshawa was a Boston feeder team) win their last ever (and maybe final ever) Stanley Cup, in 1967, when I was the tender age of 14... alas. This was the golden age of *broadcasting*, or sending a single signal to many receivers, in this case, most of the TV sets in Canada.  

This explains the first two spheres on Figure TT, numbered 1 and 2, extending the in-person experience to the home, through early radio and then TV.  Sphere number three is a bit more complex, as it introduces the confounding influence of *synchronicity* to the equation. Attending the game, or listening via radio or watching on TV are all *synchronous* events – experienced in real time (or very near real time taking *latency* into account). Sphere number three, labelled *Anywhere*, shows that it’s not necessary to be *tethered* to a location in order to experience an event. The automobile radio and the portable transistor radio were the first to *cut the cord* as it were, allowing the very first *roaming* experience. And make no mistake - it was big at the time. The ability to bring music to the beach or on a walk or to a ball game on a summer's eve was truly liberating. 

Today the ability to consume anything, anywhere, in real time is taken for granted. Thus we have a myriad of ways to experience the game, including streaming services available wherever the internet is available, on devices such as desktop and laptop computers, tablets, smart phones and smart TVs, most of which are quite portable. Commercial providers offer services varying from streamed audio, streamed audio/video, to instant, *bite-sized* updates in various forms depending on the device in use.  All these are on the synchronous side of the equation. Asynchronous media include newspaper reports, news media on radio and TV reporting (which are nothing new at all), as well as our own capacity, with a Personal Video Recorder (PVR), to *tape* an event and dissect it at any time later in all its stop and start, slow-motion glory. Time is no longer in the equation. 

And that covers the commercial providers. Increasingly important, however, is our own ability to report (share) the real-time experience for both synchronous and asynchronous consumption. Witness the rise of social media and the concept of *narrowcasting*. Twitter and Facebook are narrowcasting technologies, narrow being defined relatively. Twitter supports narrow communities of *followers* and Facebook the same concept, referred to as *friends*. I don’t need to explain these platforms to you. 

Let’s think about what could happen at a public event, such as our hockey game. With social media, you could easily narrowcast through any number of platforms. Your followers and friends could consume, in near synchronicity, your experience of the game. But let’s go farther afield and consider that you could also narrowcast a live stream of the event through technologies such as *periscope*, and *meerkat* (now concentrating on video networking) and Facebook Live which allow anyone with a camera and a connection to the internet to live stream any event. You are the new CBC. An emerging *Sportsnet*. A nascent *Hockey Night in Canada*. 

Ok so cool enough. But consider that you can be Tweeting, Facebooking and *periscoping* in real time *inside the venue* where the event is happening. Others in your sphere could well be consuming your narrowcasts, and by the same token you could be consuming theirs.  This adds a whole new dimension to the model. Finally, you could also be live narrowcasting the game to anyone on the other end of a cell phone call, or recording your play-by-play on a voicemail recorder for later consumption and analysis. 

Alas, just two days after my writing the above paragraph, The NHL itself officially banned livestreaming of its property (games) by anyone. [Mashable.com reported](http://mashable.com/2015/04/22/periscope-meerkat-banned-nhl/) that NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly announced on April 21, 2015 that: “... any streaming of footage in violation of the NHL’s Broadcast Guidelines (including, for example, live-streaming inside the arena less than 30 minutes before the start of the game) and Media Access Policy is expressly prohibited." The Mashable piece concludes with: “... the branding opportunities for organizations like the NHL seem pretty limitless: rinkside live streams of team warm-ups, exclusive interviews with players and coaches, the list goes on. So it figures: Why cede those opportunities (and future dollars) to fans?”

[Interested?](http://yhoo.it/1dkOJFp)

All of this represents a wrinkle in the space-time continuum of synchronicity and location. But what’s the bottom line here? Why does this matter other than being really cool and other than actually making it considerably less likely that we will enjoy an in-person, synchronous event? (Next time you either attend or watch a major event such as the opening or closing of the Olympic Games, note how many people are recording it, watching the pageantry through a tiny camera screen, to be played back... never?)

There is no denying that the majority of the *weightless* or the *digital* or the *intangible economy* is if not driven by, at least facilitated by, information and communication technology. So to fully participate, it’s necessary to be well versed in the technology – not necessarily to be able to *create* new technology but clearly to be able to *leverage* it. To understand it well enough to be able to see how it can solve problems or create opportunities for competitive advantage. 

And it’s also important because of ownership. And ownership is all about business because business sells access to events such as hockey games. This is why it’s a revolution. The ownership model is completely upside-down now. The ability to participate in (consume) an event is now available to any and all with a support mechanism (technology) and an internet connection (technology). So ownership of that event is now widely dispersed. Who, for example, owns the rights to a Tweet or a FB post or indeed to a live stream via *periscope* of a hockey game? And the pricing for consumption is now multi-tiered. In fact, one could argue that the price to consume many events (or movies or broadcasts of any kind – indeed at the time of writing there have been numerous reports of live-streaming feature films) has been reduced to the hit you take on your data plan. So how to generate revenue from events? How do you pay your hockey players or your screen actors? 

This at least partly explains the consolidation among entertainment providers and also why the former content *purveyors* (such as Rogers and Bell) are now content *producers*, owning major league sports teams for example, and buying up sports broadcasting properties (while Bell owns at least part of TSN, for example, and Rogers owns the Blue Jays as well as their ball park, and at the time of writing, they together hold a nearly 80% share in Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns major league teams in three leagues as well as considerable prime real estate). So the folks who formerly *brought you* the product (via cable, satellite and the internet), now own the venues, the product and the distribution channels. And in a market such as Canada, where people live and die hockey, having the purveyors of content own the competition is particularly problematic.  

[Interested in media consolidation?](http://www.dailyinfographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IllusionofChoice.jpg)

If they don’t follow this model, they risk being shoved aside by the content producers. They’ve become the creators rather than the purveyors. *Shomi* is a Rogers – Telus joint response to *Netflix* (isn’t it fun when competitors get in bed with each other – this is the definition of a strategic partnership). Bell’s *CraveTV* is the same. As of the writing of this paragraph, Rogers/Telus has announced that, just like Netflix, Shomi will be available to all as a streaming service to anyone (not just their customers). It’s the only way to compete in this world of intangible products. And it’s due in large part to the *digital revolution*. Netflix is a *disruptor*. We will return to disruptors later in this text.
 
Netflix has impacted network TV to the point of near extinction.

Back to the Policy Horizons article (*ibid*). While the article is excellent in its entirely, below is the most important material from our perspective: They write: 

“While a large part of the services sector will continue to include low-skilled work, some significant shifts for an economy that increasingly revolves around services are highlighted below.

“Economic growth increasingly linked to intangibles: The shift from a goods economy to a knowledge economy has increased the importance of intangibles. Intangible assets include brand, customer base, design, human capital, intellectual property and networks, among others, which are all essential aspects driving firm value. Investments in intangible assets are an increasingly important source of growth that could result in a new range of business services. Also reshaping services is the rise of intangible artifacts through the digitization of information and arts. Freed from the resource constraints of physical production, the economics of these markets are being transformed by a shift from relative scarcity to relative abundance, suggesting a need for different pricing mechanisms. New monetization models are emerging, no longer centred on ownership but access, such as online subscriptions or the use of targeted advertising powered by data analytics. The greater ease of replicating intangible artifacts has also increased piracy and intellectual property concerns.

“Employers cater to the 'creative class': As developed economies have found their value through knowledge creation and innovation activities, 'creative class' workers (e.g., scientists, engineers, media workers, designers) in the services sector have seen their market worth rise, while blue-collar workers and low-skilled service workers have seen little growth in their relative value, even though the latter still dominate the services industry. These creative workers tend to seek to live in diverse and creative cities and are comfortable working in flexible work arrangements such as online employment or self-employment. With the expectation of greater future competition for creative class workers, their preferences may be influential in determining workplace norms and firm location choice (Florida, 2002).

“Services increasingly crossing borders: Some service firms may find that the need for proximity to their workers becomes a moot point. Information communication technologies have facilitated the off-shoring and exporting of service tasks, which to date have largely been limited to the fields of architecture, engineering, finance, education and research and development. Services have traditionally been less tradable than goods, particularly in the most customer-facing industries such as retail and health care (Farrell et al., 2005). However, even in these fields, virtual and communications technologies are advancing the ability to bridge distance and offer personalized service, for instance through mobile health tools and applications, remotely controlled robots for high-precision surgeries, and the use of avatars and 'virtual fitting rooms' to aid online shopping for clothes. Within firms, developments in virtual technologies that can easily reproduce the human interface could expand the tradability of other service tasks, forging a pathway for the greater participation of 'virtual service workers.' Where employers are challenged to find specialized skills in their local labour market, online contracting is seen as an advantage to fill needs quickly. The transnational nature of service provision raises important questions for Canada's labour market and Canadian service providers.

“Services influenced by an aging population: Many service industries will likely see greater demand due to the needs and preferences of an aging population (e.g., personal care, health, leisure, tourism, transportation, supplementary careers). At the same time, service industries are concerned about their ability to source specific skills as needed, as they anticipate a smaller working age demographic to fill these needs. Firms are exploring incentives to retain older workers (e.g., flexible work schedules) and interventions to delay the onset of chronic ailments that might limit their ability to keep workers (e.g., offering workplace wellness programs).”

From this you should clearly see that a big part of your ability to both create new and consume existing value in society will be fuelled and facilitated by ICT. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we study ICT. You are at university to learn how to become knowledge creators. 

Indeed that is exactly what you are doing as you train and study – creating intangible and (though we do try via testing and require that you write papers for our assessment) almost immeasurable capacities for thought and synthesis and creation. The value you create in your career will not, in all likelihood, be measured on a weight scale (as in a bucket of made widgets), but rather on an ethereal scale that measures ideas, theories, mashups and disruptions. You will indeed be working in the weightless economy. Best to be prepared. 

#### Takeaways
To bring it home, we live in and are likely to remain living in an increasingly a service-based economy. Services are weightless. Weightless artifacts are intimately tied to ICT whether by services or by manufacturing. And the contribution of services to GDP is consistently outpacing all other sectors. It appears that services, and ICT-leveraging services among them, is a good place to be. Let's get trained up. 

## Pillar 3: Does this (technology/service/data/etc.) either shrink input or grow output or both?

If neither, is there any value to it? The short answer is no. That's the medium and the long answer as well. 

There are primarily four ways that a business can derive benefit by applying ICT to support the organisation and its processes:

- Supporting the value chain – As we have discussed in previous sections, systems can be applied directly to the value chain to make it more efficient and effective.
- Automating – Business processes and functions can be automated, enabling cost reductions, normally through the consumption of less labour and increased efficiency and reliability.
- Informing – ICT systems create, store, and make available data that can be used to improve the quality of business decisions, as discussed in Chapter 3.
- Gaining a competitive advantage – Implementing a new system that creates new capabilities may give an organisation a temporary competitive advantage over their competitors. 

A McKinsey piece on capitalism proposes that the purpose of business is to solve problems. Here's the quote: "... the crucial contribution business makes to society is transforming ideas into products and services that solve problems." They go on to specify that if problems are solved at an increasing rate, prosperity results. If this is true (and it makes good sense to me on the surface) then our task as we study technology becomes to determine if the product or service or technology under consideration (which is the tangible manifestation of a new idea) solves a *real* problem. 

[Interested?]( http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/corporate_social_responsibility/redefining_capitalism)

But it also seems to me that something is missing from the McKinsey postulation. And that something is *profit*. Under capitalism, for an enterprise to remain viable, it must either be supported externally or must generate a competitive return on investment. Nothing is free. Everything (and I mean everything) has a cost. So cancer research (cancer being the problem) can be supported by governments through their revenues, derived mainly from taxation. So you and I pay for that research. Some cancer research is also undertaken by private enterprise (pharmaceutical firms and university research labs as funded research, for example), but private enterprise won’t (or can’t for long) go down a road without the reasonable expectation of recouping a premium over what they have invested in their work. This is ROI. This is the basis of free enterprise and of capitalism itself. 

It’s clear that problems don’t get solved for free. If business solves a problem, it must make a profit in so doing. But there’s also the age-old challenge of widening the gap between costs and revenues. It’s not enough to make a profit. The profit must *increase* year over year. Grow the margins. Be more effective and/or more efficient. Expand the market, open new frontiers. Grow revenues and shrink costs, that’s what drives the system. Keep this in mind.

What is also interesting from the McKinsey piece is their contention that problems must be solved at an increasing rate. So this year we must solve more problems (either in absolute terms or as a rate) than last year and the year before that. Everything escalates under capitalism. Goods cost more, wages rise to meet the cost of goods and we live in this inflationary spiral which ebbs and flows but other than in rare periods of deflation (which are quickly corrected by monetary policy) is always with us. Problems must be solved at an increasing pace and profit must increase year over year. It’s enough to drive one mad. 

Thus the pace of everything is accelerating. This puts increasing pressure on the systems that businesses use to solve problems.  What then is a system?

A simple system or a complex system, any system, has only three pieces. First, input is required. Once input is present, work (a process) then transforms that input into output. That's it. Input --> Process --> Output. All three are necessary. No work process without input, no output without work, no input and work without something coming out the other side. Make sure to understand that a system also requires a trigger: something to set it in motion. Systems don't just start of their own volition (if they had any) or momentum. Something must spur them into action. Furthermore, and equally important, a system must have a *goal*; a reason for its existence; a purpose. We don't just do things because we can.

Our simple graphic above depicts a system, the goal of which is to make dairy products -- something my family did 100 years ago when their telephone number in Oshawa, Ontario was *7*. Yup, that’s it. Seven. Talk about getting in on the ground floor! 

![Riordan’s Dairy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/riordans_dairy_cap.jpg)

To make dairy products, plenty of inputs are required, including hay, corn and grass to feed the cows, milk from those cows, scientific know-how, elbow grease and muscle, expertise, time, land and, of all things, data, information and accumulated knowledge. And lots more such as a farm to nurture the cows and a dairy with machinery to bring it all together and a supply chain to move stuff in and out. The message is that in order to produce dairy, plenty of input is required.

These inputs are fed to the dairy process, and this work process yields the output: cheese and milk and yogurt and ice cream. It’s pretty clear that our little graphic represents a very high-level view of the dairy system. There are literally hundreds of other systems, linked in chains, that actually account for the production here. But each is the same; a simple process, flanked by inputs and outputs. How then, and where, is value added and profit realised? 

Let’s look at our system again, this time in light of value add. 

**Figure Z. Value creation**

![Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/value_creation.png)

### How is value created?

It sounds simple, but the entire premise upon which the capitalist system rests is that the realised output from a system (a business) must be worth *somewhat more*, in the long run, than the investment in inputs required to produce the output. Thus the goal of a business is that the difference between what you get when you sell your wares and what it costs to fuel the system to produce those wares is greater than what profits you might realise from *doing something else with your money*. This is *opportunity cost*. You have *an opportunity* to do lots of stuff with your money. You can put it in the bank, invest it, lend it (a form of investment if charging interest), or use it to buy inputs for a process that you wager will give you a better return than any or all of the other alternatives. Looked at another way, the value generated must be greater that what it would cost to borrow the money to run the business system. If you’re paying 3% to borrow money to run your business and it’s only returning a 2% margin, well... you’ve got trouble with a capital F. 

And remember that the purpose of business is to solve problems. I have added the *caveat* that those problems won’t get solved by private sector firms unless they can be solved *at a profit*. 

### How does technology add value in solving problems? 

A business is a collection of systems, large and small, simple and complex. How do we measure the value creation potential of technology in a set of complex processes? 
 
The twin concepts used in measurement of all systems are: *effectiveness – doing the right thing*, and *efficiency – doing the thing right*. Effectiveness is all about the components of a system. No process should be part of a system if it doesn’t add value at output. Nothing should be done that doesn’t need to be done. On the other hand, efficiency is all about doing the right thing in the right way, with the least waste and the maximum output. It should be clear that the top priority is effectiveness. Once the process is doing the right thing, effort can be put into doing the thing right. It’s all too easy to be really efficiently doing the *wrong thing*. 

Paradoxically, technological progress is not measured in terms of impact on the actual *business process* of doing anything. Technological change impacts business process, but it’s impact is measured elsewhere. Though this sounds heretical, in the simplest terms, technological progress is measured not in terms of process improvements, but rather by the impact such progress has on the inputs and outputs of the system -- the resultant decrease in required inputs to produce the same output or by an increase in realisable output given the same input. In the simplest terms, the ratio of realised output (what you reap when you sell) to the cost of input (what you invest in procuring inputs for your system) must be greater than 1. And it must be greater than 1 **and** in excess of what you might earn by doing something else with your money. There are many terms in business to describe this phenomenon, including *Return on Investment (ROI), Rate of Return,* and *yield.* 

Of course this is a very simple measure and there are plenty of other contingencies and vagaries of which to take account when deciding what to do with your money. Long-term ROI, however, is a must. You must eventually get a decent and competitive return on your investment in order to justify investing in a business. *The output must eventually be greater than the input.*

Let's do some very simple math here. If you dialed *7* in 1915 and asked my grandfather Joseph Riordan what his ROI was for last year and he said "None of your &@#$%& business!" you would know that you reached my grandfather. If you were to get a chance to look at the books and found that a simple ROI was 1.03, for example, but that the interest charged by lenders on borrowing capital was 4%, you might conclude that, in the short term, Joe would be better off lending his money to someone and making 4% on it. The ratio of output/input (profit) was 1.03 and the ratio of input/output (cost) was 1.04. His money was better off somewhere else. And eventually it ended that way. Another local dairy gobbled up Riordan's Dairy and many others like it in an effort to increase efficiency through scale.

### A working definition of progress
We know progress has occurred when inputs cost less for a given output or output is more plentiful or valuable from a given input. Simple. The value creation graphic (Figure ZX below) shows this clearly.

Assume a stable system where yesterday, 100 units of input produced 100 units of output. Progress has been achieved if today we get the same output from only 99 units of input. On the other end of the system, progress will also have been achieved if tomorrow those 100 units of input produce 101 units of output. Either of these might represent an increase in *effectiveness*, where we are making more *effective* use of our input resources, or an increase in *efficiency* wherein we are doing more with what we have. Message: technology effects are measured at the boundaries of the system, where we count inputs and outputs.  

Thus technology has an impact if it moves the needle on efficiency and/or effectiveness. That’s how we measure technological impact. Either it leads to cost savings on the input side or to increased realisable value on the output side. Technology has the capacity to widen the margin between costs and revenues. It can increase profit. It can also cost a lot of money and have no appreciable impact.

What if an entirely *new* solution to an existing problem emerges? What if there's no input to improve on or outputs to augment? We're still good. If it's entirely new and better than anything extant, then if must be cheaper to run or produce better outcomes, otherwise why use it? Bingo.

Finally, the part where I specify *realisable* output is important. If progress results in *so much output that it cannot be used or sold or examined or put to good use* then it's of no value, and in fact is potentially wasteful. Imagine a new variant on growing mushrooms that increased output by a factor of 100,000. *That's a lot o' 'shrooms.* What to do with them all? Is it progress if we can't realise value from it? That's a great topic for a debate someday.

Important takeaway: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) operates in the process piece of business problem solving, but its impacts are measured on the edges of the system or by calculating the ratio of input/outputs and comparing to the benefit of doing something else with your capital. See the *ICT Value creation graphic* above.

An intimately related topic is that of *Business Process Management* (BPM). Specifically, BPM has expanded its scope recently to encompass *Six Sigma* methods among others, and to specifically embrace the following functionality:

- Visualize - functions and processes
- Measure - determine the appropriate measure to determine success
- Analyze - compare the various simulations to determine an optimal improvement
- Improve - select and implement the improvement
- Control - deploy this implementation and by use of user-defined dashboards monitor the improvement in real time and feed the performance information back into the simulation model in preparation for the next improvement iteration
- Re-engineer - revamp the processes from scratch for better results

If you are interested in *Supply Chain Management* you might find BPM to be of interest.

### What *real problems* can technology solve? 
A real problem is one that either has input or output challenges – and we know by now that those are the *only* challenges. See the [McKinsey article](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/corporate_social_responsibility/redefining_capitalism). Thus in this book and this course we will examine at each juncture in discussing a piece of technology (whether it is personal productivity software or social media or an enormous enterprise system) whether the technology can be demonstrated to either reduce the cost of inputs or increase the value of outputs. If not, it simply is a waste of time and effort.

## Pillar 4: Does this product/service/technology lead to a sustainable competitive advantage?

This is developed in the context of both PERSONAL Competitive Advantage (such as FB or Twitter, etc. - needs to be carefully defined but this definition will allow us to understand the corporate part) and CORPORATE Competitive Advantage (easier to define but must also encompass not-for-profit and government services). TK

### What is competitive advantage?
All of us, every minute of every day, are in competition for scarce resources. Though not particularly *culturally inclusive*, Wikipedia (accessed June 12, 2015) has this to say on the subject [emphasis added]:

"Competition in biology and sociology, is a contest between organisms, animals, individuals, groups, etc., for territory, a niche, or a location of resources, for resources and goods, mates, for prestige, recognition, awards, or group or social status, for leadership. Competition is the opposite of cooperation. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared or which is desired individually but not in sharing and cooperation. Competition occurs naturally between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. Humans compete usually for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, prestige, and fame. **Competition is also a major tenet of market economies and business is often associated with competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers**, and also competition inside a company is usually stimulated for meeting and reaching higher quality of services or products that the company produce or develop."

The [Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/ "Visual Thesaurus") website offers a word picture on the term:

**Figure TTT. Definition of competition from Visual Thesaurus**

![Competition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/competition.png)

In discussing competition in the business context, we usually consider the struggle for *competitive advantage*. The online Business Dictionary offers the following definition:

"A superiority gained by an organization when it can provide the same value as its competitors but at a lower price, or can charge higher prices by providing greater value through differentiation. Competitive advantage results from matching core competencies to the opportunities."

[Interested?](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/competitive-advantage.html)

Broadly scoped, competition can be understood as anything that could otherwise occupy customers' time or money, *including doing nothing.* In order to sustain long-term profitability, a firm must respond strategically to competition and that’s just as much about creating value as it is about being efficient and effective. But just looking at your direct competitors is completely inadequate. Buyers can play you against your rivals to drive prices down. Suppliers can constrain profits with high prices. New entrants can bring new technology and synergies to bear, ratcheting up the investment required to remain competitive. Substitute offerings (even from outside your own industry) can lure customers away. These are Porter’s Five Forces. [Source: BUSI 3800 course notes, Fall, 2013, Robert Riordan]

Once competitive advantage is understood in terms of one firm's ability to provide superior price, quality or service over another, the discussion normally turns to *sustainable* competitive advantage. The ability to persist in this position of superiority over your competitors. To stay ahead, different and desirable. 

The question then becomes, in our context, *How can ICT contribute to sustainable competitive advantage?*

The answer is complex and not at all pretty for proponents of ICT. The back story is that ICT has become, in the words of Nicholas Carr, a *commodity*, not unlike electricity (*DOES IT MATTER?: Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage*, Harvard Business Review Press, 2004). It's all the same for every firm in every market. No firm can *sustain* a competitive advantage from ICT since it's freely available to all and is not at all *differentiated*. We will see in Chapter 2 how more and more firms are installing ERP systems (mammoth enterprise systems that manage all important processes in a firm) and that, when deciding to implement an ERP, the most cost-efficient way to do so is to accept the defaults in the system rather than customise. So firms alter their business processes to conform with the way the ERP works *rather than the other way around*. So a firm doesn't customise (in any meaningful way) the ERP. Rather, the ERP standardises the firm. And with more and more forms implementing ERPs as a *competitive necessity*, there is little of no competitive advantage left in ICT *because every firm has ICT and it operates in the same way for everyone, thus there cannot be any advantage in it*.

In addition, what Carr refers to as the *technology replication cycle* is continually being shortened. If a firm were to create their own ICT system and gain some kind of advantage from it, the entire industry will know about it very soon through the free flow of information and the fact that large tech consultancies (such as Accenture and McKinsey and Bain and Deloitte and others) hire out their ICT consultants to a wide range of companies in a market and those consultants act to diffuse the insights of particular firms to the broader community. So everyone knows fairly quickly the mechanics of the advantage. Coupled with robust and efficient technology tools to build systems quickly, a competitive advantage conferred on a firm for creating their own value-add system will soon be replicated across the industry. So *sustainable* competitive advantage is difficult.

This is not to say that there have never been cases of ICT conferring sustained advantage. For example, American Airlines automated reservations (the beginning of the end for travel agencies), pricing, and seat assignments (using yield management technology) in the 1960s and continue to enjoy some advantage to this day. And Walmart created logistics applications in the 1980s and invested heavily in *Radio Frequency Identification* (RFID) applications (though this initiative eventually lost steam) and continue to dominate rivals such as Target, Sears and Kmart. But the examples are few and far between. The value gained by standardising - the cost advantage for a firm to be like their competitors - trumps the advantages of being different.

###The two contributions of ICT to value creation

I have argued above that there are but *two impacts* that ICT can have in our individual daily lives and in the functions of every for-profit or not-for-profit enterprise, public institution and social endeavour. The first is as *Input Reducer* and the second function is that of *Output Enhancer*.  

An input reducer functions as an agent which, *at a given level of output*, reduces the unit cost of inputs such that either more input is available at the same cost, or less input is required at the same cost. An output enhancer either increases the volume of output or the value of that output, holding volume constant. 

So *context* becomes the frame of reference within which we narrow the error bands around our decisions. Context is everything, and ICT provides, or can provide, rich context. We will be examining context repeatedly in this book, because context is what drives information creation, and information drives decision making and good decisions are something that we all, as actors in both public and private scenarios, need to make. 

For now, in examining the ICT task of input reducer, we need to examine this function in terms of its ability to provide the necessary rich array of data which allow decisions to be made with relative certainty. In order to make fewer errors in our decision-making endeavours (and thus to reduce the amount of input necessary to produce the same output), we need as much context (the rich backdrop of facts, figures and shared understandings) as possible. We need to know what data means. We need to be able to put data into context to create actionable information. All this will come together in Chapter 2. 

Information systems can not only distribute that scarcest of all commodities - knowledge - but can create knowledge and understanding in socially equitable ways. It is argued that the purpose of business is to solve problems, leading to a better social situation for as many humans as possible. It is only as a by-product of problem solving that profits are generated. One could assume, however, that problems for which no profit can be made won't be solved. Unless, of course, we consider the rapidly-expanding social economy and the not-for-profit sector.

And we shall. Onward!
