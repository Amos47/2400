### Situatedness
An interesting corollary of context is the notion of *situatedness*. Oxford Reference defines it partly as:

“The dependence of meaning (and/or identity) on the specifics of particular sociohistorical, geographical, and cultural contexts, social and power relations, and philosophical and ideological frameworks, within which the multiple perspectives of social actors are *dynamically constructed, negotiated, and contested.*” [emphasis added]

Ever answered to someone “You had to be there.” in reply to the question “What’s so funny?” If so, then you appreciate *context*. The interpretation of a message or communication is dependent on the situation in which it occurs and to which it refers. Imagine how many ways a simple word like *Yes* or *No* could be interpreted when you consider situational variables such as voice inflection, facial expression, volume and the length of utterance of the speaker, emphasis on a particular word or even syllable, to name but a few. There’s an hilarious comedy skit by a Jewish comic in which he successively puts the emphasis on each word in the interrogative phrase “He said I should bring a gift?” and in so doing changes the interpretation of the phrase each time. Try it yourself: Emphasise the **bolded** word in each sentence below by making the word a question in and of itself and note how the meaning attached to the phrase changes each time:

**He?** said I should bring a gift?

He **said?** I should bring a gift?

He said **I?** should bring a gift?

He said I **should?** bring a gift?

And so forth. 

There are literally dozens of possible interpretations or meanings for a simple word, depending on the context in which the word was uttered. Misreading the context of a situation can be a very serious matter. People are in jail for it. Lives have been ruined by it. If someone has ever quoted you *out of context* then you know what we’re talking about here. So subtle and so powerful is context that we must dynamically manage all our behaviours in order to be appropriate *in context*.

Oxford suggests that context is dynamically constructed, negotiated and contested. I would add that people navigate and interpret context all the time. We are social actors who are continuously jostling for a position of advantage among our peers and contemporaries. Such is the human condition.

Consider, if you will, the enormous scope of what humans do in constructing context. Look at all the terms in Figure LJST (above) and how each nuanced difference in term conjures up a slightly different meaning for we humans. Milieu, surroundings, circumstance, setting, background, scope, ecology. arena, domain, state of affairs and indeed, *context.*   

#### Exformation
Appropriate in this context is the discussion of the concept of *Exformation*. Here I extensively quote [the exformation entry in wikipedia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exformation "Exformation") (all emphasis added by me]:

"Exformation (originally spelled *eksformation* in Danish) is a term coined by Danish science writer Tor Nørretranders in his book *The User Illusion* published in English 1998. It is meant to mean *explicitly discarded information*. However, the term also has other meanings related to information, for instance *useful and relevant information* ...

"Effective communication depends on a shared body of knowledge between the persons communicating. In using words, sounds, and gestures, the speaker has deliberately thrown away a huge body of information, though it remains implied. This shared **context** is called *exformation*.

"Exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when, or before, we say anything at all - whereas information is the measurable, demonstrable utterance we actually come out with. [see Chapter 1 of this textbook.]

If someone is talking about computers, what is said will have more meaning if the person listening has some prior idea what a computer is, what it is good for, and in what *contexts* they might encounter one. From the information content of a message alone, there is no way of measuring how much exformation it contains.

"In 1862 the author Victor Hugo wrote to his publisher asking how his most recent book, *Les Misérables*, was getting on. Hugo just wrote "?" in his message, to which his publisher replied "!", to indicate it was selling well. This exchange of messages would have no meaning to a third party because the shared context is unique to those taking part in it. The amount of information (a single character) was extremely small, and yet because of exformation a meaning is clearly conveyed."

We, with the benefit of knowing the contextual information of who wrote the note and to whom as well as what the inquiry was about (book sales), can piece together the exformation that allows us to understand the communication. We are not always so lucky, and the machines among us are at a decided disadvantage when it comes to exformation.  

**Figure JJLL. Exformation as context**

![Exformation as context](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/exformation.png)

Examine Figure JJLL and imagine time-transporting Canada's first PM, Sir John A. Macdonald, to the present day and handing him an Android device (I don't know about you, but I indulge in such fantasies regularly...). Note the massive *exformation* in this interaction - the things that we just implicitly understand about such modern devices that Sir John A. could not possibly fathom. This is context at its most obvious. 

We might think of exformation as *common sense* in a way. Common sense is *context* that is commonly held by individuals in a particular social setting. When someone says "That's just common sense!" it is understood that a person should have internalised the context in which some action was taken and have been guided by it. "It's just common sense that you need a browser to look at a webpage", for example. It's a shared understanding and a product of having been immersed in the computing culture since forever. But what of Sir John A? It would take him quite a while to come up to speed. 

Our question in this section is *“Will machines ever be able to make sense of context and exformation?"* We’ll get there in our discussion. Hang on. 

Meanwhile, take a look at context in practice. Below in Figure GH we see the distribution of scores on the 2013 high school exit examination in Poland. Is human decision making at play here ("We just can't let poor Wojciech fail... he's so close!") or have humans written a computer algorithm that contextualises grades such that "Given that scores have a confidence interval around them of say +/-3%, any score that is in the range of 27-30 should be awarded a grade of 30"? We don't know, but this is interesting *contextual rule-making*, no? Also note the small amount of what's referred to in statistical circles as *heaping* at the highest level (100%). I guess if you get close enough, what's the difference? If you log into *bit.ly* (see below) and examine the data, you will see that there were no scores of 92, 95 or 98, but that the frequency of test scores at 100% was twice that at 99% despite a pattern of continually falling percentages as the distribution approaches 100%. You might also note that no one scored a 29. There was also a bit of a heap at 31 -- so likely a 31 means you scored a legit 30 and were given a 31 so as to differentiate from those who were *gifted* a 30 - that's a message in itself. A 30 means you didn't earn it... And there's a bit of heaping at 32 up to about 36 or so as the *bumping up* continues to ripple through the distribution. An otherwise almost textbook *normal distribution* becomes the victim of context. 

**Figure GH. Context at its finest.**

### Meaning
How do we derive meaning from data or communication? Through interpreting data and facts in context. Context provides meaning for meaningless data. But what does *meaning* mean? Oxford to the rescue:

"Whatever it is that makes what would otherwise be mere sounds [...] into instruments of communication and understanding. The philosophical problem is to demystify this power, and to relate it to what we know of ourselves and the world."

[Interested?](http://bit.ly/1GoQwmb)

What we *know* of ourselves and the world is clearly *knowledge*. But from where comes knowledge?
[Oxford](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/knowledge "Oxford on knowledge") offers the following (edited for applicability in this context -- see? Context is everywhere).

Knowledge is:

1. **Facts, information**, and skills acquired by a person through **experience** or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject
2. Awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or **situation** 

The important concepts were **bolded** in the definitions above by me. Let’s look at each in turn:

1. *Facts* – facts are data; simple measurements lacking context
2. *Information* – we deal with information below, and how it is derived from data and then becomes actionable through context
3. *Experience* – comes from observation of the results of actions, which flow from decisions fuelled by actions as a result of information produced from data in a context
4. Situation – a synonym for context
