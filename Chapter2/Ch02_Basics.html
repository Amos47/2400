<h1>Chapter 2 - Basics <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/icons/32/mag_10.png" alt="Basics" /></h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<h3>In which we dig a little deeper</h3>
<p>We begin this chapter by stating unequivocally that computers have historically done a lousy job with <em>context</em>. They have been unable to understand, process and make sense of the nuanced detail of our lives and our interactions with each other and with our environment. Why? Because they have struggled with <em>knowledge</em>. They have struggled to <em>learn</em> in the way that humans learn. They have not been able to generalise either from the specific to the general or from the general to the specific. They have been unable to observe a piece of art and decide if they <em>like</em> it or not or even, until very recently, to quantify its characteristics. They have - again until recently- struggled with deciding if a painting were a Picasso, a Monet or a Da Vinci. And this is where context and knowledge intersect. Read on.</p>
<p>Those kind of tasks -- appreciating beauty, creating music, writing poetry - have been the exclusive purview of humans because computers lacked the ability to create and appreciate <em>context</em>. They can’t see the <em>bigger picture</em>. All this is changing. With the differences between data, information and knowledge behind us, much of this chapter will focus on context.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/contextual-computing">TechTarget.com</a> provides this definition of contextual computing: &quot;<em>Contextual computing, also called context-aware computing, is the use of software and hardware to automatically collect and analyze data about a device's surroundings in order to present relevant, actionable information to the end user.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>We already know that data becomes information when it's contextualised and becomes actionable. As fastcodesign.com has written, <em>&quot;The future of Technology isn't Mobile, it's Contextual.&quot;</em> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672531/the-future-of-technology-isnt-mobile-its-contextual">Interested?</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Figure DC. The definition of context from Visual Thesaurus</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/vt_context.PNG" alt="visualthesaurus.com Definition of context" /></p>
<p>The Visual Thesaurus definition for context reads, in part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Language that helps to determine its interpretation </li>
<li>The set of facts or circumstances that surround a situation or event</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the two definitions, the second is most important for us. I have written elsewhere that data are <em>facts</em>. Just pieces of unencumbered specifics, the result of the measurement of some phenomenon. <em>Circumstance</em>, on the other hand, is a collection of facts which together frame the <em>situation</em> or <em>condition</em>. It’s the <em>fact bath</em> in which we continuously find ourselves. It’s all the stuff that happens <em>around</em> an event at a place and time that give us the ability to weave a rich fabric of meaning related to the event and allows us to reduce the error around what’s happening in a particular setting. Here's what the online <em>Oxford Reference</em> has to say about context:</p>
<p>&quot;Most broadly, any frame of reference or framework within which something is perceived, produced, consumed, communicated, interpreted, or otherwise experienced, or which is seen as relevant to the description or analysis of any phenomenon.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1ITF5oD">Interested?</a></p>
<p>The salient parts of that definition refer to the <em>frame of reference</em> within which <em>something is perceived, consumed... or otherwise experienced...</em> Why so important? Because context is everything. As humans, we live in a contextual stew of signs, signals, impressions, facts and suspicions. Computers haven’t quite been able to figure us out. Yet.</p>
<p>So what is context? Another way to look at it is by examining what we mean by the term <em>situation</em>. Here's what the Visual Thesaurus has to show on that term:</p>
<p><strong>Figure LJST. The definition of <em>situation</em> from Visual Thesaurus</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/vt_situation.png" alt="visualthesaurus.com Definition of context" /></p>
<p>The specific Visual Thesaurus definition presented in LJST pertains to &quot;the general state of things; the combination of circumstances at a given time.&quot; It is here where we find <em>context</em> crossing with <em>situation</em>, <em>surroundings</em> and <em>circumstance</em>.  </p>
<p>Think for the moment of the process of getting ready for an adventure outside the home. Going to school maybe, or work, or just for a walk. Think about the decisions that need to be made, focusing on what to wear. If you and I are even remotely alike, then you have a range of things to put on your back -- but what to wear today? First level of decision, likely made with no conscious thought whatsoever, is to consider the season - and you might move clothing in and out of rotation based on season. Thus the season provides the largest or highest level (most abstract) <em>context</em> in which is made the decision of what to wear outside. Season sets the broad parameters. Fact: It’s cold in winter and hot in summer and spring and fall are a crap shoot. </p>
<p>Next in line is likely the general state of the weather, within the broader context of season. If it's winter, is it sunny and cold or is a blizzard raging? Finally, just hearing that it's cold outside is insufficient context. As we know, being good Canadians, there's Winnipeg or Ottawa cold and then there's Vancouver or Niagara cold. Not the same thing at all. <em>Ergo</em> &quot;cold&quot; is a qualitative and relative measure, relative to the context of where one currently finds oneself and doesn't much help us to decide on apparel. Summer cold is a different beast entirely from winter cold. Consider further the tug-of-war between the Alberta Clipper and the Chinooks. Even being in Canada in the winter can cause wide swings in temperature. </p>
<p>Let's just drive this home by considering temperature in a little more detail. In determining what to wear, we might be wise to consult a weather service. Navigate to a website or click a <em>Follow me</em> app such as <a href="http://www.theweathernetwork.com">The Weather Network</a> (and isn't the function of 'follow me weather' to provide the <strong>context</strong> of where one is currently located?) on your device or switch on the TV and select the weather channel (where a local context will already be provided because the weather channel <em>knows</em> where the signal is being viewed and thus provides the proper geo-context for you). Normally the current temperature is the most salient factor, thus we might find a large <strong>20</strong> prominently displayed on the screen. Not to put too fine a point on it, and you've likely already caught on, but <em>20 degrees</em> indicates entirely different weather in Toronto as opposed to just across the lake in Buffalo - even on a day where the objective weather is nearly the same in both cities. That's owing to, obviously, the scale of temperature being measured in <em>Fahrenheit</em> in Buffalo and <em>Celsius</em> in Toronto. Twenty F is below freezing in Buffalo whereas 20 C is t-shirt weather in Toronto. So the context of location, regardless of the actual weather, is important. And this also speaks to measurement. </p>
<p><em>Context drives interpretation</em>. Context makes information out of data and allows us to make decisions.</p>
<p>And now, just to really make this a challenge, consider the final bowl of contextual stew in which we find ourselves. <em>Fashion. Whim. Trends. Expectations. Style.</em> How do I feel today? Is it before or after Labour Day? Should my pants and jacket be from the same design house? Do I dare wear a department store label? What did I wear last time I was with the people I'm likely to see today? What will they expect me to wear, given that I just got a promotion at work? Will <em>she</em> or <em>ever. he</em> be there? What kind of person do I need to be today? This is all context.</p>
<p>Often, when someone reminds me of a particularly silly or ill-conceived decision I have made in the past, I glibly justify by stating &quot;Oh, <strong>that</strong> was during my pastel phase.&quot; It's meaningless banter meant to deflect criticism in a lighthearted way but... what if it were true? What if I did have a <em>pastel phase</em>, whatever that might mean. Indeed, how could we ever expect a machine to decode and enforce the rules around such a thing whether in the present (&quot;I'm only wearing chalk tones these days!&quot;) or when examining the past (&quot;Oh, well, I must be excused for that behaviour -- I was under the influence at the time&quot;)?</p>
<p>Fashion is a tall order for people, let alone machines. And people often get fashion wrong - take a stroll through Tim Horton's. Worse still, fashion is <em>opinion</em> driven by the huge influence juggernaut we call <em>marketing</em>. How is a context-starved, computing machine to keep up?  </p>
<h3>Situatedness</h3>
<p>An interesting corollary of context is the notion of <em>situatedness</em>. Oxford Reference defines it partly as:</p>
<p>“The dependence of meaning (and/or identity) on the specifics of particular sociohistorical, geographical, and cultural contexts, social and power relations, and philosophical and ideological frameworks, within which the multiple perspectives of social actors are <em>dynamically constructed, negotiated, and contested.</em>” [emphasis added] </p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1svpjLY">Interested?</a></p>
<p>Ever answered to someone “You had to be there.” in reply to the question “What’s so funny?” If so, then you appreciate <em>context</em>. The interpretation of a message or communication is dependent on the situation in which it occurs and to which it refers. Imagine how many ways a simple word like <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> could be interpreted when you consider situational variables such as voice inflection, facial expression, volume and the length of utterance of the speaker, emphasis on a particular word or even syllable, to name but a few. There’s an hilarious comedy skit in which the comedian successively puts the emphasis on each word in the interrogative phrase “He said I should bring a gift?” and in so doing changes the interpretation of the phrase each time. Try it yourself: Emphasise the <strong>bolded</strong> word in each sentence below by making the word a question in and of itself and note how the meaning attached to the phrase changes each time:</p>
<p><strong>He?</strong> said I should bring a gift?</p>
<p>He <strong>said?</strong> I should bring a gift?</p>
<p>He said <strong>I?</strong> should bring a gift?</p>
<p>He said I <strong>should?</strong> bring a gift?</p>
<p>And so forth. </p>
<p>There are literally dozens of possible interpretations or meanings for a simple word, depending on the context in which the word was uttered. Misreading the context of a situation can be a very serious matter. People are in jail for it. Lives have been ruined by it. If someone has ever quoted you <em>out of context</em> then you know what we’re talking about here. So subtle and so powerful is context that we must dynamically manage all our behaviours in order to be appropriate <em>in context</em>.</p>
<p>The Oxford Dictionary suggests that context is dynamically constructed, negotiated and contested. I would add that people navigate and interpret context all the time. We are social actors who are continuously jostling for a position of advantage among our peers and contemporaries. Such is the human condition. Consider, if you will, the enormous scope of what humans do in constructing context. Look at all the terms in Figure LJST (above) and how each nuanced difference in term conjures up a slightly different meaning for we humans. Milieu, surroundings, circumstance, setting, background, scope, ecology, arena, domain, state of affairs and indeed, <em>context.</em>   </p>

<p>An excellent paper on context can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/gvu/tr/1999/99-22.pdf">here</a>. While much too complex to be considered for an Interested? link, it's a great first place to start if you want deep understanding of context, in the context (!!) of application design. Here is a pertinent quote from that piece: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;If a piece of information can be used to characterize the situation of a participant in an interaction, then that information is context.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In understanding context, consider for a moment that we might be in the classroom. The fact that we are present at that location at that moment makes this unique. There will never be another now with all of us at this place at our current age with our current knowledge in our current state of being. We can never relive the seconds that are passing by right now. This context is not reproducible (but stay tuned for Chapter 6...). So <em>Time</em> is the most basic determinant of context. </p>
<p>Beyond the ticking of time, is there something unique about the periodicity of our meetings here? We meet (but <em>we</em> changes week to week and indeed minute to minute as people come and go - see <em>Team</em>) every (whatever day at whatever time for roughly three hours) for 12 weeks in the same place except for one week sometime in the middle when we all go to our respective corners to read for a week. Eventually some of us (along with many others in a different venue - see Terroir) will meet later at the exam (which is a different context) and then never, ever again will we all be together in the same place (except maybe at convocation which is a different <em>Terroir</em> and a different <em>Time</em> and a different context with a different <em>Team</em>). </p>
<p>Yet with all the complexity of <em>Time, Terroir</em> and <em>Team</em>. we intrinsically understand this fairly loose grouping to be something beyond its mere constituent parts. <em>We understand this to be a school class.</em> We know what happens here. We know how this works. If you or almost anyone else in advanced society were to walk by and see this scene you would immediately know what was happening. It's a classroom. We share massive <em>exformation</em> about this context (for a discussion of exformation, see the Backstory to this chapter 
<a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#exformation" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>. But could we have a class that met on a random schedule for a variable length of time in a random location and wouldn't it still be a class? If so, then what is the essence of this thing called <em>class</em>? </p>
<p>What's important is that we are in the same place at the same time. So <em>THE</em> place isn't important but <em>A</em> place is. Also important in this context is <em>Team</em>. And there must be two or more agents present, and one must be the teacher or leader. This implies <em>Tools</em>. The leader must have the right tools, and knowledge is a tool. Also <em>Time</em> is critical. We must be present at the same time, therefore synchronously. But <em>Terroir</em> can now be virtual. We can be <em>present</em> via technology so the network becomes the <em>Terroir</em>. We need to argue about whether this is the same context. Is a virtual context the same? </p>
<p>We will not consider asynchronous teaching to be the classroom context because canned, watch-at-your-leisure instruction is not the same as the classroom context where the value is at least partly derived from togetherness. </p>
<p>But imagine a machine trying to figure out the context of our little get-togethers. How would we quantify (digitise) this experience such that a machine could <em>learn</em> how to recognise this context and call it a <em>class</em>? There are several approaches to this dilemma, but the resolution is to recognise when enough data has been provided such that more would provide no additional ROI. We need to know when the machine has learned enough such that it can mimic our own accuracy in creating the context. At what point is it <em>good enough</em>? How is it to contextualise the data that flows into this classroom context? </p>
<p>Next let's consider <em>Terroir</em> (place). <em>Terroir</em> is the term that winemakers use to distinguish one wine from another even when a wine is made from the same grape and maybe even by the same winemaker but in a different place and time. Vintners maintain that the specifics of the soil (from where the term originates - the English word 'earth' is 'terre' in French) and rain and temperature and exact light conditions create a specific grape harvest that could never occur at any other but this intersection of those characteristics. So in a very real sense, a particular vintage of wine is the embodiment of context. Thus the importance of <em>Terroir</em> is established. </p>
<p><em>Trail</em> or history is next. I argue here that a context is dependent on one or more previous contexts in order to exist. The classroom context, for example, has a very specific history. Beyond the obvious precursors of an existing university with students and a physical classroom with proper furniture, the <em>Team's</em> lecturers must have knowledge and experience to impart, and students need to have the prerequisite tools and skills to allow them to learn. I am hard pressed to think of a context that is not dependent on a previous context - that is since the Big Bang... </p>
<p>And this is where <em>Task</em> comes in. <em>Tools</em> and <em>Tasks</em> go hand in hand. A context might well be assembled out of the need to complete a task with a set of tools with one or more actors on the <em>Team</em>. In our discussion of the classroom context, the <em>Task</em> is to learn something. The <em>Team</em> is assembled in a <em>Terroir</em> with various technology <em>Tools</em> in order to complete a task: learning. Is <em>Task</em> necessary for context? I say yes. Our life is the constant movement towards deciding whether and how to change course to reach a goal. That goal is survival and nothing else. The goal is the same for an organisation as for an individual. We are always on the road to determining when a decision needs to be made because the universe is in constant flux and these changes throw up barriers to survival. So the accumulation of knowledge involves making decisions and observing the outcomes in order to shrink the error around future decisions. People get really good at it with time - it's called <em>experience</em>. That's why we write books; to use our experience to reduce error for those navigating the path behind us. And maybe to have just a little of who we are, survive. </p>
<p>Finally, we consider <em>Tools</em>. This refers to the toolkit which we have available at the time of the occurrence of the context which we use to dissect and analyse the situation and interpret/create the context. A microscope is a tool, as is a telescope and a thermometer. A more familiar to business students tool might be a financial or a Porter's Five Forces analysis. Tools all. And technology, as we have learned, is a tool. Technology embodies previous experience with context such that we can create a set of rules (a blueprint) to build many copies of a house or we can use a Robertson screwdriver to drive Robertson screws when they occur in our context. A Robertson screwdriver (or a Phillips if you are more USA-oriented) is simply a codified piece of context used over and over in the same situation for the same job - driving a screw. </p>
<p>The opposite of context is vacuum. Physical scientists use vacuum to examine the effects of one thing on another in complete isolation of other contextual influences. It's an artificial environment. And as we have been taught, nature abhors a vacuum. A vacuum lacks context. We can't make decisions in a vacuum. So how to we go about making decisions and creating knowledge? Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Our discussion of context suggests a simple and general model of knowledge acquisition that applies to all creatures, great and small, that are faced with making decisions. But where does this all fit in terms of business? </p>

<p>Examine Figure LJLJ from left to right. Imagine this simplification is modelling the <em>Big Bang</em> inasmuch as we pretend this to be the first ever measurement of a phenomenon in a state of complete <em>nescience</em> (utter absence of knowledge); the very first ever occurrence of this data; perhaps the very first sale on the first day of a new business where everything is all brand new. View it as a system in the way we understand systems from the introductory chapter where <em>d</em> (data) is the input and <em>K</em> (knowledge) is the output. The only existing elements are measurements (m), which make the data tangible (length, for example, is a concept or a variable; 6 cm. is tangible data and a fact representing the length of something being measured). </p>
<p>There might well be a question or a challenge creating a strategy vacuum and drawing data into that question context. It’s also possible that exploratory research is driving the data initiative, as in “Let’s look at our data and see what it has to tell us...” with no particular agenda in mind. </p>
<p>Regardless of what nudged the process into action (remember that systems need a trigger in order to start), the ensuing process is the same. It begins as newly-measured data approach from the boundary of the system and become understood in a <em>context</em> where the data become <em>information</em>. This creation of new information allows a decision to be made, and decisions lead either to <em>action</em> or <em>inaction</em>. Action/inaction leads to outcomes, the measurement of which yield new data (measured observations) in the context of that situation, which leads ultimately to knowledge (experienced gained by observing the outcomes of the action/inaction in this particular context). </p>
<p>This is a general theory of how data are transformed into knowledge. </p>
<p>There are thus two contexts in each chain from data to knowledge. There’s the initial context with the decision and action/inaction attendant upon it, then there’s the context resulting from the action/inaction. This is how we gain knowledge. We act or stand still. We experiment. We make decisions and we see what happens. But there is a much richer model to come, wherein we benefit from our accumulated knowledge and our observations of context. That’s the only real reason for any of this. To get better at what we do based on experience. Hang on. </p>
<h4><em>Important takeaway</em></h4>
<p><em>It’s important to note that</em> <strong>information only occurs within a context</strong>, <em>and</em> <strong>each context is, by definition, unique</strong>. <em>There can be similar contexts, contexts that share traits with others, but each context is itself unique. The universe ticks ahead and an infinite array of things change with each tick. Thus it’s important to bring an optimal (not too much, not too little) amount of data to bear on a particular context, as it will never occur again. Everything changes in the ticking of the clock. We will return to this.</em></p>
<p>Let’s re-examine our clothing decision in light of this theory.  </p>
<p>Imagine a new friend has just landed from Mars. Our visitor needs to venture outdoors to find food and has insufficient earthly contextual experience upon which to base a choice of whether or what clothing to wear. Our Martian friend has an objective measurement of temperature (temperature being a universal construct and all living organisms are sensitive to temperature and have an <em>operating range</em> outside of which they cannot function), is aware of their location (earth) and of the star date, and finally that they have a certain tolerance for temperature (this is accumulated knowledge). <em>But what to wear?</em> </p>
<p>In our knowledge-acquisition model, there is <em>always</em> context. The context in this case is that there is precious little data upon which to base the information required to choose what to wear (if clothing is worn by Martians...?). So in this context, our travelling friend might simply choose to wear nothing (a choice to take no action) while going for a stroll to the supermarket. Turns out today is February 10th and we’re in Iqaluit. A tad chilly. The result of this decision to take no dressing action is that our friend experiences intense cold against an unprotected body and the ambient temperature is outside the sustainable operating range of a healthy Martian. Their body measures the temperature and the effects of that temperature and this data, in the new context, becomes information. This information in this context, in association with the information provided by the initial context, becomes knowledge. Now our friend has a bead on what to wear in the next, similar, context. They have gained some <em>knowledge</em>. </p>
<p>The nugget of knowledge for our little green friend is that at this temperature on this date in this location taking no action to protect oneself from the elements is potentially damaging. <em>Bingo.</em> Knowledge and a new context upon which to base further action. Walk through this scenario again with this knowledge but with the same Martian in the same situation on July 10. What would the process look like? </p>
<p>To answer this question, we must move to the more elaborated model of knowledge acquisition (or decision making if you prefer). See Figure LAJ.</p>
<p><strong>Figure LAJ: The flow of data into contextual information to decision, action and knowledge</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/context.png" alt="Context" /></p>
<p>In Figure LAJ we see illustrated how the process of measurement (m), whether conscious or not, provides a value for a new piece of data (d), which in combination with existing, measured data (whether newly-measured or previously measured) flows into a new context (circle) where new information (blue) is produced when combined with knowledge available through feedback from previous contexts (green feedback arrow). This new <em>mashup</em> provides the necessary ingredients for a new decision. It is here where <em>understanding</em> occurs. The decision begets some results, whether through action or inaction, which, in turn, creates new information in this new context. This new information in turn, feeds knowledge from observing the outcome of the action. This new knowledge (K), in combination with prior knowledge, in its accumulated glory, washes back over any new context. The creation of knowledge is thus a dynamic, fluid and constant activity for living organisms and inanimate entities such as organisations alike. </p>
<p>You might also like to characterise the second context as the place where <em>meaning</em> is created. In response to the following question: &quot;The challenge is not to gather information, but to make sense of the information we have?&quot;, science historian George Dyson replied &quot;Right. We now live in a world where information is potentially unlimited. Information is cheap, but meaning is expensive. Where is the meaning? Only human beings can tell you where it is. We’re extracting meaning from our minds and our own lives.&quot; </p>
<p>While I am not at all pretending to be a thinker of the calibre of Dyson, my interpretation of his response is that he is alluding to <em>context</em>, the place where we come to understand the consequences of actionable information.  While it's a bit heavy, you might be <a href="http://www.theeuropean-magazine.com/352-dyson-george/353-evolution-and-innovation">Interested in Dyson?</a>. If you choose the Dyson article as the basis for one of your test answers, pick three Q&amp;A pairs from the article upon which to focus.   </p>
<p>We might also be inclined to characterise the feedback loop as <em>experience</em>. Experience provides important input into the creation of information in a new context. While each context is, by definition, unique, many (probably most) contexts we experience in life are only slightly different from some previous context. Think of a series of classes in the same subject, for example. Clearly, experience with the subject matter has an impact. Think of moving to a new city and using public transit. While the exact situation will differ (different buses perhaps, and different payment methods and routes and drivers and seating arrangements), prior experience with taking a bus (<em>any</em> bus) will help smooth the transition to the new environment. The same can be said for driving a car. Once you have learned to drive (a steep learning curve), transitioning to a different car is <em>relatively</em> easy. You might also think of this as <em>exformation</em> (for a discussion of exformation, see the Backstory to this chapter 
<a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#exformation" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>.  </p>
<p>Thus experience is important in interpreting context, which is how information is created.   </p>
<h3>Schemata and knowledge acquisition</h3>
<p>The model of knowledge acquisition elucidated here is not inconsistent with, and may be seen as an extension of, the work done in the fields of Psychology and Cognitive Science in the area of <em>schemata</em>. Pioneering work by Bartlett, extended by Jean Piaget, (see the Interested? links below) suggests that people learn about and make sense of their work by building, modifying, extending and discarding mental models of how things work. A quick (and brutally naïve) explanation and example follows.</p>
<p>The first premise necessary to accept if one subscribes to the <em>schema notion</em> of knowledge acquisition is that of <em>tabula rasa</em>, loosely translated and understood to mean <em>blank slate</em>, as in a blank chalk board in a classroom. As far back as Aristotle, the notion that humans are born with a blank slate mind has been popular. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa">Interested?</a> This <em>blank slate</em> is written on, erased, altered and generally enhanced as humans grow, learn and acquire knowledge. So at the first encounter of a child with a dog, for example, the rudimentary schema of <em>dog</em> is created that inscribes the observed characteristics of the dog (a creature with four legs, fur, a tail and a long snout of a nose, etc.) to the dog schema. A parent labels the creature <em>dog</em> and our kid is off to the races, able to recognise all manner of four-legged creatures forever more. </p>
<p>But trouble looms...</p>
<p>Next, our intrepid young dog expert encounters a cow. Slightly bigger, but hey, it’s got four legs, fur, a snout and a tail. Must be a dog. So our schema builder spots the cow and happily announces the results of their interpretation to a parent: “Dog!” Nope, the parent corrects, that’s a cow (and probably makes a mooing sound to reinforce the difference). New schema in order here. At the same time, it’s possible that a <em>super schema</em> is also developed, this one encompassing the characteristics we know as <em>animal</em> and containing the attributes “four legs, fur, tail, long snout” of which <em>dog</em> and <em>cow</em> are specific examples. <em>Dog</em> might now have an encoded attribute for <em>size</em> that would differentiate the dog from the cow based on bulk. But <em>calf</em> and <em>pony</em> and <em>puppy</em> and <em>kitten</em> present problems, necessitating further refinements of the existing schemata. Isn't a small calf about the same size as a really big dog? We won’t even get into the difference between a house cat (and the colour variation) and the myriad of <em>jungle cats</em>. Learning can be frustrating. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/an_executives_guide_to_machine_learning" title="Machine Learning">McKinsey report on Machine Learning</a> had the following to say about how machines are <em>taught</em> to recognise simple things like cows and cats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 2007 Fei-Fei Li, the head of Stanford’s [University] Artificial Intelligence Lab, gave up trying to program computers to recognize objects and began labeling the millions of raw images that a child might encounter by age three and feeding them to computers. By being shown thousands and thousands of labeled data sets with instances of, say, a cat, the machine could shape its own rules for deciding whether a particular set of digital pixels was, in fact, a cat. Last November, Li’s team unveiled a program that identifies the visual elements of any picture with a high degree of accuracy. IBM’s Watson machine relied on a similar self-generated scoring system among hundreds of potential answers to crush the world’s best Jeopardy! players in 2011.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is through continual exposure to new data and continual feedback based on made decisions emanating from such exposure that specific and actionable knowledge is created and stored. You can see that the notion of context fits nicely here (well maybe you can’t see yet, but I can and I hope you will come to an understanding of these principles as we progress). It is also very interesting to note the similarities between the schemas of cognitive psychology and the software development technique known as <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> (or OOP). I’ll try to remember to revisit that connection in the chapter on Systems Development... <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/icons/32/Bubble_6.png" alt="Basics" />   </p>
<p>Knowledge acquisition (also referred to as the process of <em>Knowledge Engineering</em>) is also the biggest obstacle to creating <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> (AI). If we have time to fit that in somewhere, it will likely be in the chapter on <em>Future Trends</em>. While we’re here, I also strongly recommend a course (or even picking up a book on the topic) in <em>Cognitive Psychology</em> for anyone interested in ICT, Marketing, Finance or Management. It’s so cool you might just fall in love.  </p>
<p>[Interested in schemas?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)
<a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-knowledge-acquisition.htm">Interested in knowledge acquisition?</a></p>
<p>Knowledge acquisition can be seen as a system, with the four main entities identified by coloured background ovals in Figure LAJ. On the left is <em>Input</em>, flowing into <em>Process</em>, which produces <em>Output</em> which is fed back into the system as <em>Input</em> to the continuous process of knowledge production and acquisition. And don't overlook the important tenet that much of the data that enters a decision process as input, and equally previous knowledge that is fed back to the decision-making process, functions as <em>context</em>. It is the soup made from the situation and the previous experience that allows us to decide how to move forward. All the ingredients of the soup together allow us to decide if we like the taste. </p>
<h4>Important takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>context</em> is a new, unique and non-reoccurring circumstance created out of the intersection of existing and new data and existing knowledge gained from previous contexts. It can only occur once and it's gone. Time marches on. No two contexts are alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since contexts (and thus decisions emanating from the information created in them) are unique, it is critical to provide the optimal (note I didn’t write <em>maximal</em> as too much data can be as confounding as too little data) amount of data and knowledge as input to the context. There is no substitute for accurately-measured data and accumulated knowledge. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision quality is a function of reducing error around the decision outcome. Accumulated knowledge from previous contexts and of the outcomes of decisions attendant upon them will reduce error. Better decisions are the result. If you have <em>seen stuff like this before</em> and have <em>observed the outcome</em> you are clearly in a better position to make a more accurate prediction of the future, and thus better decisions about how to get there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge is accumulated by observing results of action/inaction in context. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom is knowing how and when to use it...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's put this into the context of the input/output ratio we discussed in Chapter 1. In order to get better at the process of making decisions, we need to improve at the margins. We either need less or less expensive measurement and data acquisition on the input side, or we need better quality output from the process. Knowledge gained from previous experience of observing outcomes from decisions provide much richer and much more targeted inputs to subsequent decisions. The feedback loop over the top of the process provides us with much better quality inputs (less noise so less expensive and more targeted) which in turn enrich our ability to make subsequent decisions in similar contexts. Experience matters. And ICT can help at every stage of the knowledge acquisition process. This is how we get better at making decisions. </p>
<h2>Contextualisation and the role of ICT</h2>
<p>We can now provide a little more depth in terms of contextualisation and the role of ICT in the process. Examine Figure LLJJ below. It’s the same figure as LJLJ above, but with the ICT contributions overlaid on each element. </p>
<p><strong>Figure LLJJ. Context with ICT contribution</strong>
<a name="context_ict"></a>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/ict_context.png" alt="ICT context" /></p>
<h3>System input</h3>
<p>As our discussion moves from left to right in Figure LLJJ, each area is marked with a numbered black box for easier reference. </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/gaping_void_measurement.PNG" alt="Measurement?" /></p>
<p>The Gaping Void artist, Hugh MacLeod, writes this about his measurement piece above: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Measurement is a good and necessary thing. That which gets measured, gets done etc. The problem is, measurement for measurement’s sake is stagnant. It can be a crutch, just like anything else. It can be an especially unhelpful crutch, when it starts becoming a substitute for creativity, risk taking and yes, actual thinking. Like the executive who confuses <em>Facebook Likes</em> with actual sales. Or confusing a temporary spike in store traffic with fixing an actual long-term marketing  problem. The temptation is to think that, just because something is making your life easier, you can start taking short cuts. It doesn’t work that way.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So measurement itself isn't sufficient to change the input/output ratio. But it's a necessary ingredient. And that's where we start. At the input end of the context system, we begin pre-data, with measurement. <strong>This is Area 1.</strong> ICT provides several critical functions in terms of data measurement, beginning at the very basic level of <em>sensing</em>. ICT systems are deployed in a myriad of situations as sensors, simply sitting quietly and waiting for something to happen. Sensing a phenomenon is often akin to measuring it – a photon of light passing through a pane of glass, for example, causes a count of photons to tick up by one. An RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system on a gas pump continuously broadcasts its presence, waiting for a customer’s matching key fob transmitter to spring to life in response to the signal. Then all kinds of commerce can happen. Sensors are everywhere from parking lots to soft drink dispensers and from washrooms to smart phones. And more and more sensors are being deployed all the time. We will return to this topic a number of times as we move forward, including in the Backstory of this chapter where we discussed sensors and <em>beacons</em> in a bit more depth 
<a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#sens-beac" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement">Interested in measurement?</a></p>
<p>ICT can of course measure things independent of sensing. A scale on the highway measures truck weight in the same way a bathroom scale measures our own weight. A radar gun measures speed. An elevator measures weight and will refuse to close its doors if overloaded. An accelerometer measures the speed of your finger swipe on a tablet computer in order to calibrate the throwing of a lance at an invading barbarian to protect your virtual village from attack. All are measurement devices. In performing this function, ICT systems must be engineered to respect the most critical tenet of measurement: <em>accuracy</em> and its constituents, <em>trueness</em> and <em>precision</em>, and including <em>reproducibility</em>. Once measured, the same data must yield the same results using the same technique. This is sometimes referred to as <em>reliability</em>. We discussed these things in the Backstory to Chapter 1 <a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#katz" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>.</p>
<p>On to <strong>Area 2</strong>. Note also that the infographic implies that a lot of data just <em>fly right by</em> the system. This is true in two ways. First, data that has no known bearing on the current context has no value in this system and will be ignored. Data about vehicle fuel efficiency, no matter how accurate and reliable, simply cannot add to the context of a decision about the marketing of disposable diapers, for example (though both involve tailpipe emissions). It’s simply not in the domain. So this data flies right by <em>or is actively filtered out as non-information</em> - see Backstory and Katz's information types <a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#katz" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>. </p>
<p>Next, however, is a more important aspect. There is simply so much data being generated every micro-second (5 Exabytes every two days according to Google chairman Eric Schmidt (see below), though this is contentious... <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/">Interested?</a>) that it’s impossible to capture it all in either its incredible volume or to process it in a timely manner before it becomes stale, so vast is the big data cloud. But what’s important is to capture an optimal amount in order to create the richest context and thus the most informed information, leading to the most accurate decisions about a course of action.</p>
<p><strong>Figure BGJ. Data generation</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/schmidt.png" alt="How much data is out there?" /></p>
<p>Another compelling visualisation of the amount of data generated is provided in Figure WTP.</p>
<p><strong>Figure WTP. Data generation</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/DataNeverSleeps.jpg" alt="Data never sleeps" /></p>
<p>This leads to the next contribution of ICT to the area of decision making and knowledge acquisition, that of dealing with the data itself. ICT systems can act as data filters, enforcing rules about relevancy, domain, accuracy, freshness and reliability. Data can be fed through systems and sorted, filtered, combined and then stored for later use. When required, systems can assemble and package data into usable formats (a spreadsheet format for example) and can then send them on their way to other systems for analysis (via network file sharing or even email). This is referred to as <em>marshalling</em>. At a low level, operating systems (such as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's iOS) support marshalling through file management allowing us to store data under a single name in either short- or long-term memory. In a very real way, data marshalling is like railway marshalling, where huge networks of track are used to <em>assemble</em> trains. Much like at the rail yard, ICT can store, slice and dice and then assemble and transport data. A one-stop shop for management. </p>
<p><strong>Photo TTA. A railway marshalling yard in Germany</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/trainyard.jpg" alt="How much data is out there?" /></p>

<p>This can be understood in terms of the input/output dichotomy in a variety of ways. Can ICT reduce the amount of input required to produce a given output? Yes, in many situations. Even simple filtering and sorting, arranging and, in true Weiner fashion, reducing the uncertainty around input data, can contribute to more streamlined and efficient processes and thus satisfy the <em>less input</em> tenet of our <em>contribution to progress</em> rule.   </p>
<p>Moving to the area at the boundary between input and processing, we enter one of the most crucial and hot areas in ICT: <em>context and information creation</em>. We’ve spent some considerable time talking about context and information in context, so all we need here is to elaborate on how ICT contributes to and supports the activities in this area. <strong>This is Area 3.</strong></p>
<p>At this point, be sure to take a look at the <em>sensors and beacons</em> section in Chapter 2's Backstory<a class="underlined-link" href="Ch02_Backstory.md\#sens_beac" target="_blank">(take me there)</a>.</p>
<p>We now need to talk about information and what ICT can do for and with the creation of information out of data in context.  So back we go to Figure LLJJ to now consider the role played by ICT in the creation of information in the context (the confluence of contemporaneous activity = all the other $hit going on at the same time) in which we find the facts = measured data. This is <strong>Area 4</strong>. Given all that is going on at the same time, we need to focus on the available data, decide whether it is applicable, usable, reliable, up-to-date, etc., then create information out of the data (remember that information is actionable whereas data is not) and decide whether to act or not and if so, how to act. All this is about decision making. Recall also that we need the optimal amount of data in the context in order to create the optimal information and inform our subsequent decisions. This is a lot to swallow all at once, but people do it all the time, and organisations are expected to do it in a timely, rational, inclusive, profitable, equitable, respectful, mindful and repeatable way. It’s no mean feat. </p>
<p>ICT can help with this process by effecting data analysis, by synthesising (blending and amalgamating existing data and previous information pertinent to the task at hand) and by creating information (linking context to data). Information, once created, can be managed, stored, transported and reported upon by various ICT systems. It is functionally impossible for organisations to do even one of these tasks efficiently given the volume of information, while respecting the time constraints within which decisions must be made, without the substantial assistance of machines and systems. It’s simply impossible to keep up. </p>
<h3>Where the magic happens</h3>
<p>Beyond analysis and synthesis of existing data and information in context, ICT also <em>creates</em> information in context. <strong>This is perhaps the most critical role of ICT in the entire process of knowledge acquisition.</strong> <em>This is where the magic happens</em>. This is the confluence of fact and circumstance and measurement and existing knowledge coming together to produce an understanding, at some level, of the decision space. An understanding of the problem or challenge and of the circumstance surrounding it such that a decision can be formulated out of the new information created in the new unique context that is this moment in space and time. This is the way forward. </p>
<p>I know this sounds eerily sci-fi or even spiritual. Not so. It’s something that we humans do continuously without even being aware of it. Machines do it also, but not as well as we. Yet. We are at the frontier of machines being able to recognise the boundaries of context. Able to ascertain what’s in and what’s out of scope. Creating information that bears on the problem and the solution space. Making sense of data in that context. And making decisions for us. This is to where ICT is going. We can't just go along for the ride. <em>We need to keep up with technology or it will overtake our ability to realise value from its work.</em></p>
<p>All the tools are available and in the public domain. The infrastructure already exists for a rapid and radical alteration of the computing landscape. In a recent issue of <em>The Economist</em> I read the following paragraph in an article entitled <em>Who's afraid of America?</em> on the subject of weapons technology: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The large lead that America enjoyed then [1980s] has dwindled. Although the Pentagon has greatly refined and improved the technologies [... they] have also proliferated and become far cheaper. Colossal computational power, rapid data processing, sophisticated sensors and bandwidth [...] are now widely available.&quot; Source:The Economist, Volume 415, Number 8942, June 13th-19th 2015. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's all out there and being leveraged for value creation. </p>
<p>When the information is created within the context, ICT can then assist in the more mundane activities of filtering for relevancy (as we have seen in our discussion of the functions of ICT in the management of information, misinformation, etc.), marshalling, managing, transporting, and reporting on it to various functions within the organisation (or just to us, as users, if it’s a local bit of information such as how many Tweets you issued in the past 24 hours – this is information and 67 TPD (tweets per day) is a report of that information to you). </p>
<p>Let's bring back Figure LLJJ for a refresher.</p>
<p><strong>Figure LLJJ. Context with ICT contribution</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/ict_context.png" alt="ICT context" /></p>
<p>Moving on, we next tackle the role of technology in making decisions (not acting on decisions just yet) but in <em>making</em> decisions. This is <strong>Area 5</strong>. How about a few simple examples of machines making decisions for us?  </p>
<p>Consider the heating and cooling systems we enjoy in our homes, vehicles, places of work and public spaces. They constantly monitor the ambient temperature and turn on and off to match some parameters we set (such as desired temperature). Next consider red-light traffic cameras - an entirely automated process from flash to cash. Then think of active all-wheel drive in a vehicle, constantly monitoring the wheel rotations on all four corners of the vehicle and adjusting the amount of torque sent to the wheel to compensate for slippage. Then think of cruise control and self-parking cars and adaptive volume levels in sound systems and the list goes on. All decisions made for us with no input other than, at times, setting some default values. Such decisions are made constantly and far beneath our consciousness or our ability to do the same. Imagine we drivers having to take over for an adaptive all-wheel drive system and manually making a thousand adjustments per wheel per second. Impossible. </p>
<p>Thinking just about self-parking cars will help to cement the notion of <em>context</em> when you realise that this activity is all about context and almost nothing else. The context includes determining if the space is large enough to accommodate the about-to-be-parked vehicle, and then about exactly where in space the obstacles are (cars in front and/or behind) as well as location of the curb (if present), road conditions, ambient light, speed of approach, arc of attack and a myriad of other variables that describe the solution space for parking. Data is turned into information and then action. </p>
<p>In parking, context is everything.  </p>
<p>ICT can both make decisions and <em>act on them</em>. This is <strong>Area 6.</strong> ICT can also record and store the conditions leading to the decision, what decision was made, and the context of the decision – such as the current thermometer reading and time/date when a decision was made to change the thermostat setting in your home. In addition, ICT can report all this information to anyone or any system that requires it for whatever purpose. Moreover, is can <em>combine</em> such information with sensor data indicating who and how many people are in the room, the season, the external temperature, the lighting conditions, the relative humidity, the time of day and how often the temperature changes and a myriad of other usage data that just flies by in our homes every second we are there. This is the genesis for the <em>Nest</em> system, bought by Google in early 2014 for 3.2B USD. </p>
<p><a href="https://nest.com/ca/">Interested?</a></p>
<p>ICT can also execute decisions (take action) as a consequence of human intervention (we can decide to send an email, for example, and the machine will do our bidding). When executing, it can record and store the context of the execution action as well as monitoring and policing its own actions and provide an audit of its activities - such as adherence to policies, for example. Everything about your email is recorded in multiple places.   </p>
<p>Moving to the right in Figure LLJJ, we encounter the work of ICT in sensing and storing the results of the actions executed by human and beast. This is <strong>Area 7.</strong> In this realm, ICT can both sense the results of actions and store those results for further analysis. At any juncture, as with any other activity undertaken by ICT, systems can report on their activities. To whom they report is a critical aspect of privacy.

<p>Moving again to the right in Figure LLJJ, we again encounter the impact of ICT on the Data and Information entities. This is <strong>Area 8 and 9.</strong> Here the actions and impacts are the same as in our previous discussion of data and information creating in context (Areas 2 and 3) so we won’t belabour them here. </p>
<p>We come penultimately to the Knowledge component of Figure LLJJ. This is <strong>Area 10.</strong> Here we find the culmination of the process of acquiring knowledge from measurement of data. This represents the ultimate human activity – the creation of order and reason out of action. ICT assists in many of the components of this activity, beginning with analysis of the stream of information emanating from the process. ICT can analyse existing knowledge as well as synthesise new and existing knowledge into unique nuggets of new information. Then it can manage, store and report on such knowledge. These latter processes are accomplished by <em>Knowledge Management Systems</em> (KMS).</p>

<p>The source at the Interested link above has this to say about KM (accessed March 28, 2016):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Knowledge management is essentially about getting the right knowledge to the right person at the right time. This in itself may not seem so complex, but it implies a strong tie to corporate strategy, understanding of where and in what forms knowledge exists, creating processes that span organizational functions, and ensuring that initiatives are accepted and supported by organizational members. Knowledge management may also include new knowledge creation, or it may solely focus on knowledge sharing, storage, and refinement.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We next tackle the feedback piece and talk about the synthesis of new with existing knowledge and how it washes back over new and unique contexts to become input to the next set of decisions.</p>

<p>New knowledge (the big blue cloud in Figure LLJJ), once created as output from the system, accumulates with other isolated instances of knowledge in the space at the end of the long journey from measurement. Here, in the company of other nuggets of knowledge, is where humans excel. We are currently (though fleetingly) better than machines at making connections between disparate pieces of knowledge to create new realities and new value. This new and continuously-evolving knowledge, in a synthesis with existing information (which might be unrelated to each other or to the knowledge synthesised previously) washes back over the process in a continual loop of measurement, data, information, action and knowledge creation. This is how we learn and how we move forward and profit from our successes and our failures, our actions and our inactions. This is how we create. This is where disparate pieces of information come together as knowledge and inform the way forward. This is <em>learning</em>. This is <strong>Area 11.</strong> </p>
<p>The process of knowledge creation and continuous improvement is a complex example of a simple system as described in Chapter 1. We note here the importance of ICT. When properly sourced, configured, deployed, managed and leveraged, ICT has an impact (and often a crucial one) on information creation, strategy and tactics and finally knowledge creation in an organisation. We would be lost without it. As technology advances, machines have become more and more capable of learning in the way humans learn, just as described in Figure LLJJ. Machines are maturing. Wait for it. </p>
