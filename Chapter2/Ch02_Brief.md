##Chapter 2 - Brief ![Brief](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/icons/32/suitcase_7.png)

Chapter 2 ties together the loose ends of Chapter 1 in terms of data, information and knowledge and how they are created and used in decision making in the organisation. The groundwork and concepts laid in Chapter 1 leads nicely to the discussion of type of information (Katz's Information Hierarchy) and to the discussion of Exformation (our shared understanding of the context of our lives). Machines do not share this exformation and thus are at a disadvantage in their task of creating context. But it's argued that with the increasing appearance of sensors and beacons, coupled with cloud storage, always-on computing and fast communication, machines are poised to overtake humans in their capacity to make intelligent decisions. Much of Chapter 2 is dedicated to the discussion of context. 

Though machines are binary in nature (digital; on-off; 0:1) the increasing accuracy of their measurement activities, in combination with the sheer amount of sensing and data processing happening in real time, will soon allow machines to be "good enough" at modelling analog stuff such that we will approach a state of "liquid information" wherein the difference between human and machine is minimised.

Read Chapter 2 *Basics* before finishing up with *Backstory*. Happy reading!
