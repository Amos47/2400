In the very beginning, at the murky start of time, there was nothing. Or perhaps even less than that. Maybe *negative* nothing? But of course negative nothing is something, so maybe not. Or maybe there was already everything, but not something? In any event, at the instant of the *Big Bang* (with apologies to Sheldon *et al*), there was instantly something. It was the very first binary data. Nothing, then something. Zero then one. Off became on. Dark begat light. Up was different from down. In became relative to out. You get the picture. 

And so it began. Data began to accumulate at that very instant.  

Brief

Basics

Backstory 

***Welcome to the study of ICT!***

Let's get the dry, most academic stuff possible out of the way early, with a quote from the *Association for Computing Machinery, the Association for Information Systems* and the *Association of Information Systems Professionals* who, from time to time, get together and bang out a position paper on what should be taught to students in information systems in various university and college faculties and programs. The most recent such update is from 2010 (a newer version is expected soon). The full document is available [here](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula/IS%202010%20ACM%20final.pdf). But this is  the gist of what you need to know about what they think ICT is (even though they don't use the term *Information and Communication Technology* or the abbreviation (ICT), I do so in this text). That aside, here's what they say on page 13, *for the record*:

*"Information Systems as a field of academic study encompasses the concepts, principles, and processes for two broad areas of activity within organizations: (1) acquisition, deployment, and management of information technology resources and services (the information systems function) and (2) development, operation, and evolution of infrastructure and systems for use in organizational processes (system development, system operation, and system maintenance). The systems that deliver information and communications services in an organization combine both technical components and human operators and users. They capture, store, process, and communicate data, information, and knowledge.*

*"The information systems function in an organization has a broad responsibility to plan, develop or acquire, implement, and manage an infrastructure of information technology (computers and communications), data (both internal and external), and enterprise-wide information processing systems. It has the responsibility to track new information technology and assist in incorporating it into the organization's strategy, planning, and practices. The function also supports departmental and individual information technology systems. The technology employed may range from large centralized to mobile distributed systems. The development and management of the information technology infrastructure and processing systems may involve organizational employees, consultants, and outsourcing services.* 

*"The activity of developing or acquiring information technology applications for organizational and inter-organizational processes involves projects that define creative and productive use of information technology for transaction processing, data acquisition, communication, coordination, analysis, and decision support. Design, development or acquisition, and implementation techniques, technology, and methodologies are employed. Processes for creating and implementing information systems in organizations incorporate concepts of business process design, innovation, quality, human-machine systems, human-machine interfaces, e-business design, sociotechnical systems, and change management.*

*"Information systems professionals work with information technology and must have sound technical knowledge of computers, communications, and software. Since they operate within organizations and with organizational systems, they must also understand organizations and the functions within organizations (accounting, finance, marketing, operations, human resources, and so forth). They must understand concepts and processes for achieving organizational goals with information technology. The academic content of an information systems degree program therefore includes:*

*[1] information technology,* 

*[2] information systems management,* 

*[3] information systems development and implementation,* 

*[4] organizational functions, and* 

*[5] concepts and processes of organizational management."*

We will endeavour to hit ACM proclamations 1, 2 and 3 *very* hard, and 4 and 5 slightly less so, in this book. If you are in an ICT concentration or degree program, other courses of study will backfill your knowledge of the remaining requirements.

With the formalities out of the way, there are four important pillars upon which we will focus in this opening chapter. They form the basis of all subsequent discussion throughout this text. They are:

1. Are we talking data, information or knowledge?
2. Is what we are examining a tangible or an intangible?
3. Does this (technology/service/data/etc.) either shrink input or grow output or both?
4. Does this product/service/technology or strategy lead to a positive and sustainable competitive advantage?

So let's get started.
