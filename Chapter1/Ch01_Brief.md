# Chapter 1 
### In which we introduce some critical context

There are four important pillars upon which we will build the foundation of our study in this opening chapter. They form the basis of all subsequent discussion throughout this text. They are:

1. Are we talking data, information or knowledge?
2. Is what we are examining a tangible or an intangible?
3. Does this (technology/service/data/etc.) either shrink input or grow output or both?
4. Does this product/service/technology or strategy lead to a positive and sustainable competitive advantage?

So let's get started.

In chapter 1, we delve deeply into what the three key terms *Data, Information* and *Knowledge* mean, and how they are related. Measurement leads to data, context allows data to become information and consequences of action or inaction, based on information, become knowledge. Once we've set the stage with these big three concepts, we define *Communication* and finally *Technology*. 

The next pillar, tangibility, leads to a discussion of services, of the move in modern (and modernising) economies away from manufacturing, mining and farming and towards a service-based economy. We'll see that even in China, the manufacturing powerhouse of the world over the past couple of decades, the contribution of services (intangibles) to GDP now exceeds that of manufacturing.

In the final pillar, we'll discuss how value is created, how progress is measured and what contribution ICT can make to solving problems and creating value.
