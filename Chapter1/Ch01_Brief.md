### In which we introduce some critical context

There are three important pillars that form the basis of studying ICT. They are:

1. Data, information and knowledge
2. Tangible vs. intangible
3. Impact on the input/output ratio

So let's get started.

In chapter 1, we delve deeply into what the three key terms *Data, Information* and *Knowledge* mean, and how they are related. Measurement leads to data, context allows data to become information and consequences of action or inaction, based on information, become knowledge. Once we've set the stage with these big three concepts, we define *Communication* and finally *Technology*. 

The next pillar, tangibility, leads to a discussion of services, of the move in modern (and modernising) economies away from manufacturing, mining and farming and towards a service-based economy. We'll see that even in China, the manufacturing powerhouse of the world over the past couple of decades, the contribution of services (intangibles) to GDP now exceeds that of manufacturing. It's difficult to talk of services without talking also about ICT. 

In the final pillar, we'll discuss how value is created, how progress is measured and what contribution ICT can make to solving problems and creating value.

Let's begin with a quote from Kevin Kelly's 2016 book entitled *The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future*. 

"At the center of every significant change in our lives today is a technology of some sort. Technology is humanity's accelerant. Because of technology everything we make is always in the process of becoming. Every kind of thing is becoming something else, while it churns from "might" to "is." All is flux. Nothing is finished. Nothing is done. This ever-ending change is the pivotal axis of the modern world."

Kevin Kelly is the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, and a former editor/publisher of the Whole Earth Review. His book (which I *strongly* recommend you read) was published by Viking (Penguin Random House) on June 7 2016. ISBN 9780525428084.
