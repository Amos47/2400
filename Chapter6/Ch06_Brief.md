 ###What's in store for ICT?
 
 ####What does Mckinsey think?
 
Mckinsey is a very well-known full-range management consultancy. Here's what they say about themselves on their website:
 
>McKinsey is a global firm, comprising more than 9,000 consultants and nearly 2,000 research and information professionals.
>
>Our clients reflect our global nature. Around 40% are in Europe, 35% in the Americas, 15% in Asia Pacific and 10% in the Middle East and Africa. We serve a broad mix of private-, public-, and social-sector organizations.
>

I receive their newsletters and regulary read their research work on a wide variety of topics but, as you might imagine, I read mostly their ICT related material. It struck me one day as I saw their *Top 10 this quarter* email arrive, in which they provide links to the, you guessed it, top 10 articles in the previous quarter, that it would be interesting to see, among those top 10, how many related to technology, breaodly speaking. Mckinsey consults on everything management, not just ICT, but how important is ICT in their overall portfolio (or at least how important is it to their readers)? What were those top 10 publications for the April-June quarter of 2016? Here's the list, with some added commentary:

1. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/how-blockchains-could-change-the-world?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*How blockchains could change the world*.</a>   I cover blockchains extensively in this chapter because I, like McKinsey and others, think it's a revolutionary technology that can solve a lot of problems. Look for it in the Basics section of Chapter 6.
2. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/ahead-of-the-curve-the-future-of-performance-management?cid=other-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*Ahead of the curve: The future of perfomnance management.*</a> While many companies are dropping the onerous and frustrating *annual review of employee performance* (for a lot of very good reasons), what is being substituted is, according to Mckinsey, a *big data* initiative to collect large amounts of a variety of data on a continuous basis. Technology will play an increasingly large role in HR operations. Even bigger than it does already. They write: 
>"Good data are crucial to the new processes, not least because so many employees think that the current evaluation processes are full of subjectivity. Rather than relying on a once-a-year, inexact analysis of individuals, companies can get better information by using systems that crowdsource and collect data on the performance of people and teams. Continually crowd-sourcing performance data throughout the year yields even better insights." 
3. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/an-incumbents-guide-to-digital-disruption?cid=digistrat-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*An incumbent's guide to digital disruption.*</a> Not much more needs to be said about this piece. It's all about examining existing firms in industries that are susceptible to challenges from nimble tech firms.
4. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-four-building-blocks--of-change?cid=other-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*The four building blocks of change.*</a>  This article makes almost no mention of technology. As such, it stands out from the majority of the other most popular articles. It concerns itself with *Change Management*, a process often *initiated* by changes in technology but which has little direct relationship with tech. 
5. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-economic-essentials-of-digital-strategy?cid=strategy-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*The economic esentials of digital strategy.*</a> We use the tool outlined in this artivcle for a series of Crew Challenges in BUSI 2400. Little more needs to be said about anything that has *digital* in the title. It's about tech. 
6. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/why-investors-may-need-to-lower-their-sights?cid=other-eml-alt-mgi-mgi-oth-1607" target="_blank">*Why investors need to lower their sights.*</a>  One of the very hotest topics these days in Finance is *eFinance*. This report includes the following: 
>"While digitization and disruptive technologies could boost margins for some companies, the big North American and Western European firms that took the largest share of the global profit pool in the past 30 years face new competitive pressures from emerging-market companies, technology giants, and digital platform-enabled smaller rivals. These forces may curtail margins going forward."
7. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-consumer-decision-journey?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*The consumer decision journey.*</a> This piece is all about how consumers make a decision about which brand to buy and, while the internet has had a substantial impact on our knowledge of and ability to reserch brands, tech is only peripherally related to this piece.
8. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/staying-one-step-ahead-at-pixar-an-interview-with-ed-catmull?cid=digistrat-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*Staying one step ahead at Pixar: An interview with Ed Catmull.*</a> Pixar is all about technology. It's how it makes movies and makes money. Pixar is a tech firm at its very heart. 
9. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch?cid=other-eml-alt-mgi-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*Urban world" The global consumers to watch.*</a>  This piece is all about demographics and is a compelling article for anyone to read. I highly recommend it. Though the internet will increasingly facilitate global purchasing, this article isn't about tech *per se*, but read it anyway! 
10. <a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-sales-secrets-of-high-growth-companies?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck-oth-1607" target="_blank">*The sales secrets of high-growth companies.*</a> Among the five *secrets* in this piece, two are all about tech: Analytics and *Doing* Digital. The other three topics were varied and not focussed on any one aspect. 

So of the ten, fully seven are either completly or substantially about tech. That's a pretty good indication of where you need to focus if you want to face the future with confidence. Read Chapter 6 carefully and stay tuned. Your work career will almost certainly depend on having a good grasp of tech, no matter what field you are in - and I can almost guarantee that you will be in many fields over your work life.
