###The Singularity

Way back in 2012, Dilbert predicted the day would come when machines would be intelligent enough (some call this *sentience*) to *create* themselves. Here's what that looked like:

Now just short of four years later, Dilbert's creator, Scott Adams, returns Dilbert to his prescient prediction:

To begin, let's establish an excellent resource for looking up the gobbeldygook craziness of technology terminology. Need to know what a particular technology means in (almost) human terms? Check out Gartner's [IT Glossary](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/). Keep this resource close. You'll use it often.

We begin by looking at Gartner Group's Emerging Technology Hype Cycle. The 2014 version was the most recent available at time of writing.

**Figure EC. Gartner's Emerging Technology Hype Cycle**

![Gartner Group Emerging Tech Hype Cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/hype_cycle_2014.png)

Let's unpack the graphic. First of all, the Gartner Group is a large IT consultancy with offices worldwide and a great reputation in the IT consultancy field. Each year, they release research on emerging (up-and-coming) technology, and in a novel way, fit it to a curve of their own design. The curve is both a visual and semantic indicator of the _life_ of a piece of technology from Innovation Trigger (red section on the left of the chart) to Plateau of Productivity (the green section on the far right). [Here](http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/technology-for-innovation-in-marketing/) are some historical ones for reference. 

There are five _phases_ to the cycle. Here's how each is explained by [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) with the my comments in [square parens]:

"Each Hype Cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

"Technology [or Innovation] Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven. [Think of Twitter in the early days. It was cool for sure, but how to make money from it?]

"Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not. [This is the stage at which so-called *wearables* (such as the Apple iWatch) are currently located. They are all cool and people are tripping over themselves to get them, but is there a real future or is it all hype? To frame it in the context of our book here, will they either reduce input requirements or increase outputs? And if they *do* increase output, we need to very carefully examine whether or not the output is actually *valuable*. As an outlandish example, if the output were to include *average hair follicle growth rate*, would that really be *valuable* as opposed to *cool* or *interesting*... We need to metricise the output to determine if it's affording real value. ]

"Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters. [Technology located here is not a failure! It's simple the life cycle stage where all the *hype* has worn off. It's technology in the spot where it will either live or die; if it lives, it moves on to the Slope of Enlightenment" as productive applications are found and exploited.] 

"Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious. [Note that 3D printing technologies are in this phase.]

"Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off." [Here we find stuff such as *speech recognition* and *natural language processing*; things that have made Apple's Siri and Microsoft's new Windows 10 Cortana popular.]  

[[Interested?](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918)]

Let's now take a look at some of the technology plotted on the curve, beginning with tech that Gartner thinks is at least 10 years out. Ten years from now, you will be early in your career and probably looking to move up the ladder. What kind of technology can you expect to be maturing (that is, on the *Plateau of Productivity* end of the curve), if it survives the treacherous middle of the curve mortality that fells so much tech. *Human Augmentation* might be entering the profitable stage. The Bionic Human might become a reality. Super-human athletes and soldiers and police and fire fighters could become a routine part of life. And bio-controlled prosthetics could become commonplace. Amputees will be able to function at a level approaching the performance of the wholly able-bodied. 

And now the Emerging Technology Roadmap.

![Value Zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/value_zone.png)

It's in the Telematics/Usage/Data exhaust box where we are finding a lot of value being generated by what were traditional manufacturers or service providers who now find that their data are as or more valuable than their product/service. Witness Uber, Google, GE and Ford (see the industries tab in OneNote.   

The bait must be tasty to the fish, not the fisher. 

Uber might disrupt parcel delivery (FedEx, UPS, Purolater), pizza and prescription delivery, newspaper distribution, mail delivery and anything else that's on the road. Uber can sell their on-road experience (real time) data to lots of ppl and could probably make a living just being on the road and f the taxi industry shit. What else can they disrupt? Real-time traffic, security patrol (random though), city maintenance surveillance, predictive policing, 

The sharing economy: http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/adapting-to-the-sharing-economy/

There is a difference between "recall" (to bring back from memory; recollect; remember) and "memory" (the mental capacity or faculty of retaining and reviving facts, events, *impressions*, etc., or of recalling or recognizing previous *experiences*; this faculty as possessed by a particular individual; the act or fact of retaining and recalling *impressions*, facts, etc.; remembrance; recollection). ICT does recall. People do memory. Nothing new can possibly be created out of recall. Memory, especially *curated* memory (which is what we do: "to pull together, sift through, and select for presentation, as music or website content") creates new and novel and revolutionary content.

Humans Are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines Never Will
Geoff Colvin

Review
“Beautifully written and deeply researched, Humans Are Underrated is one of the most creative and insightful leadership books I have ever read. It is a triumph!”
—DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, Pulitzer Prize–winning historian

“A powerful exposition of the strengths and limitations of technology in shaping our lives and addressing today’s greatest challenges. More than ever, as Colvin demonstrates, we need people who embody the most human of qualities. An uplifting account of the enduring potential of humanity itself.”
—PAUL POLMAN, CEO, Unilever

“As machines inexorably become ever more competent at doing machinelike things, interpersonal skills, irreplaceable skills of human interaction, will come to be recognized as being even more valuable than they’ve always been. This is an extremely important, highly practical, and indeed exhilarating book.”
—SIR MARTIN SORRELL, CEO, WPP

“Through a series of practical case studies and insights, Colvin clearly demonstrates that—regardless of where the future takes us—emotional intelligence will remain one of the most valuable human skills and the Human Element will remain a differentiator.” 
—ANDREW N. LIVERIS, chairman and CEO, Dow Chemical Company

“Geoff Colvin’s fresh take on how to respond to the rise of brilliant machines and the changing nature of work is as wise as it is inspiring.”
—DOMINIC BARTON, global managing director, McKinsey & Company

“Corporate leaders often say, ‘People come first.’ True innovation is realized only when their actions match their words.” 
—ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, Nasdaq

Product Description
As technology races ahead, what will people do better than computers?

What hope will there be for us when computers can drive cars better than humans, predict Supreme Court decisions better than legal experts, identify faces, scurry helpfully around offices and factories, even perform some surgeries, all faster, more reliably, and less expensively than people?

It’s easy to imagine a nightmare scenario in which computers simply take over most of the tasks that people now get paid to do. While we’ll still need high-level decision makers and computer developers, those tasks won’t keep most working-age people employed or allow their living standard to rise. The unavoidable question—will millions of people lose out, unable to best the machine?—is increasingly dominating business, education, economics, and policy.

The bestselling author of Talent Is Overrated explains how the skills the economy values are changing in historic ways. The abilities that will prove most essential to our success are no longer the technical, classroom-taught left-brain skills that economic advances have demanded from workers in the past. Instead, our greatest advantage lies in what we humans are most powerfully driven to do for and with one another, arising from our deepest, most essentially human abilities—empathy, creativity, social sensitivity, storytelling, humor, building relationships, and expressing ourselves with greater power than logic can ever achieve. This is how we create durable value that is not easily replicated by technology — because we’re hardwired to want it from humans.

These high-value skills create tremendous competitive advantage — more devoted customers, stronger cultures, breakthrough ideas, and more effective teams. And while many of us regard these abilities as innate traits — “he’s a real people person,” “she’s naturally creative” — it turns out they can all be developed. They're already being developed in a range of far-sighted organizations, such as:

• the Cleveland Clinic, which emphasizes empathy training of doctors and all employees to improve patient outcomes and lower medical costs; 
• the U.S. Army, which has revolutionized its training to focus on human interaction, leading to stronger teams and greater success in real-world missions;
• Stanford Business School, which has overhauled its curriculum to teach interpersonal skills through human-to-human experiences.

As technology advances, we shouldn't focus on beating computers at what they do — we’ll lose that contest. Instead, we must develop our most essential human abilities and teach our kids to value not just technology but also the richness of interpersonal experience. They will be the most valuable people in our world because of it. Colvin proves that to a far greater degree than most of us ever imagined, we already have what it takes to be great.

##Blockchains

Probably the single biggest impact technology over the next decade will be *Blockchains*. This technology (a set of rules on how to use technology), which is behind such popular initiatives as Bitcoin, is poised to revolutionise the way we interect with each other, with public institutions and with platform enterprises such as Uber, Facebook and Twitter.

What is a Blockchain? A blockchains is, simply speaking, a distributed ledger. Ledgers exactly as you ahve studied in your introductory accounting classes. Everyone who participates in the blockchain has their own copy of the ledger - this can mean that there can be millions of copies of the ledger spread across what can be a vast network of participants. And the ledger grows with each transaction. Using Bitcoin as an example, two participants in the network can exchange services for funds simply by the purchaser broadcasting a message to the network that their account should be decremented by *x* amount, and the receiver's account should be incremented by the same amount. This *proposed transaction* (we'll get back to why it's only *proposed* below) is then recorded in each copy of the ledger across the network of participants. So every participant has a copy of every transaction that has ever or will ever occur in the network for as long as they remain participants.

If you agreed to participate in Bitcoin, for example, the entire collection of every transaction that ever occured in the Bitcoin network is downloaded onto your computer and is processed back through the chain from that moment to the very first creation of the very first Bitcoin. This can take over 24 hours. Note the two figures below. This reconcilliation occured on my own desktop computer. 

**Figure KJTA. Bitcoin reconcilliation (start)**

![Bitcoin process begin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/bitcoin_synchro_install.png)

Note the highlighted sections at the bottom, indicating where we are at in the process. Seems I joined the Bitcon game about 7 years and some weeks late. As my old maching chunked away at reconcilliation, we see the status some 28 hours later, below.

What's unuque and groundbreaking about such a system is that, unlike the way we are accustomed to doing business, through large financial organisations such as banks, where unless a transaction were the subject of an investigation, details are hidden from all but the bank itself and the participants, with blockchain networks such as Bitcoin, everyone sees every transaction. It's the ultimate hippy commune. What we don't know, however, is the *identitiy* of the participants. We see that a transaction has occurred between a and b and we see the amount that was transferred, we do not and should not know who a and b are. 

###Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)###

In doing transactions on the network, the sender and recipient of a transaction don't use their real identities. Rather they use *digital signatures* (see below) which allow both parties to verify their authenticity without revealing their true identities. Such signatures are made possible through a tried-and-true technology known as *PKI* or *Public Key Infraxtructure*. Participants in blockchain networks use PKI to generate a unique signature each time they initiate a transaction. PKI works by genertating two keys (digital hashes - see below): a private key that only the owner knows and a public key that anyone can use and which proves that the public key belongs to the owner of the private key. 

[Interested in PKI?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)

The first step is to install a digital wallet (or equivalent - email clients can do the same thing for you). You then ask the wallet to generate a private key for you. This private key never changes and must be safeguarded. If you lose your private key, you also lose all claim to anything based on your public key as they depend on each other. Once you have a private key, the wallet will allow you to generate any number of public keys. Only the holder of the private key can unlock the contents of a message encrypted with a particular public key. The sender of the transaction must initiate and send the message to move something from their possession to the possession of another. A payee can also request a payment by sending their address to the payer's address and sepcifying the amount. This private/public key technology is an inmportant component of a *digital signature*, as we will see below. 

####Digital signatures

As we learned above, digital signatures are based on PKI (which is also also known as *asymmetric cryptography*). PKI algorithms such as RSA can be used to generate two keys that are mathematically linked: one private and one public. To create a digital signature, signing software (such as an email program) creates a one-way *hash* (see below) of the electronic data to be signed. In a blockchain transaction such as Bitcoin, this electronic data consists of your signature (I know this sounds circular - just hang on), the signature of the party to whom you are sending Bitcoins, the hash of the previous block in the chain, and finally a random digit t the end. We will come back to this in some detail later. We take all this electronic data and then use the private key to encrypt the hash. All this together is the digital signature. 

??? The reason for encrypting the hash instead of the entire message or document is that a hash function can convert an arbitrary input into a fixed length value, which is usually much shorter. This saves time since hashing is much faster than signing. ???


###Using blockchains for transactions

Here's how it works. To transfer ownership of something you own to someone else (in Bitcoin this is bitcoin funds but it could be anything as we will later explain), both parties must have an account on the system used for the exchange. For person A to transfer ownership to person B, all that is required is that A send a message to the network that they want to transfer some amount of whatever is being traded from A to B. Each recipient of the message updates their local copy of the blockchain to reflect the change, and passes the message on to the next node. This message contains the *digital signature* of both the sender and the recipient. Thus the message is to send *x* from the account of the owner of digital signature *A* to the account of the owner of digital signature *B*. Since the identities of both parties to the transaction are *protected by* PKI, the exchange is completely private, even though all participants in the network can see the transaction. So what's a digital signature?

###Hash (no not *that* kind)###

A hash is a well-used and time-honoured function from Computer Science that is used to map (create a path) from digital input data of arbitrary (random) size to digital output data of a fixed (known and predictable) size. 

But more importantly, Blockchain hashes are *cryptographic*. A cryptographic hash has certain characteristics, the most important of which is that it can't be reverse-engineered to recreate the input data without having to endeavour to use all possible combinations to see which one produced the same output. Such hashes are called *one-way*. You can't figure out the input by looking at the output. And this is critical. But there are other critical things as well. Here are the three big ones according to Wikipedia:

1. Pre-image resistance - Given a hash value h it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of one-way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
2. Second pre-image resistance - Given an input m1 it should be difficult to find different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second-preimage attacks.
3. Collision resistance - It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for preimage-resistance; otherwise collisions may be found by a birthday attack.

The article continues that "These properties imply that a malicious adversary cannot replace or modify the input data without changing its digest. Thus, if two strings have the same digest, one can be very confident that they are identical."

[Interested?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)

We know what transactions are from our discussions of Transaction Processing Systems (TPS); a transaction is simply a record of the exchange of something for something else: money for a product or service, for example. So transactions are simple. And transactions are the very basis of our financial and banking systems. It's simple accounting.

###Artificial Intelligence

Mnay jokes have been made over the years about just which group best represnets *the artificially intelligent*. Is it politicians? How about referees and judges in sports? A frontrunner has been academics. We won't settle it here.  Better to concentrate on the growing prowess of machines towards becoming sentient (thinking, aware, concious entities). 

THe blue oval with the cogs and hand indicates that either a machine or a human could take the action.
