###Disruption

**Figure KANB. Definition of Disruption**

Of these, we are of course most interested in the third definition. 

Forbes writes this:
>"People are sometimes confused about the difference between innovation and disruption. It's not exactly black and white, but there are real distinctions, and it's not just splitting hairs. Think of it this way: Disruptors are innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors -- in the same way that a square is a rectangle but not all rectangles are squares. Still with me?

>"Innovation and disruption are similar in that they are both makers and builders. Disruption takes a left turn by literally uprooting and changing how we think, behave, do business, learn and go about our day-to-day. Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen says that a disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative."

<a class="underlined-link" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2013/03/27/you-say-innovator-i-say-disruptor-whats-the-difference/#44e871c5bd79" target="_blank">Source</a>

It's also important to distinguish disruption from *automation*. Simply automating something is impacting an existing process and altering the Input/Output ratio (ROI) on that process. That's great. But it's not disruption.  

Clay Christensen (Disruptor's Dilemma) writes that there are two types of disruption. Low end and new market. Low-end disruption involves a cheaper, faster or more convenient (can you say input/output ratio?) way to serve an existing market while a new-market disruption involves addressing a market that previously could not be served - essentially creating an entirely new market. 

The following is from the Tech Crunch Interested? link below. The author writes about Christensen:

>"An incumbent in the market finds it almost impossible to respond to a disruptive product. In a new-market disruption, the unserved customers are unserved precisely because serving them would be unprofitable given the incumbent’s business model. In a low-end disruption, the customers lost typically are unprofitable for the incumbents, so the big companies are happy to lose them.
Thus, the innovator’s dilemma. Incumbents appropriately ignore the new product because it is uneconomic to respond, but the incumbents’ quiescence can lead to their later downfall."

<a class="underlined-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/16/the-truth-about-disruption/" target="_blank">Interested?</a>

Our primary interest is in disruption that is facilitated by ICT. Uber is a great example, both because most everyone is familiar with it and because it's a clear example of a low-end disruption that is all about tech. Uber is no more a taxi (or transportation) company that AirBnB is a hotelier or TaskRabbit (https://www.taskrabbit.com/) is a maintenance company. All of them have used ICT to facilitate transactions between willing sellers and buyers. They have created */platforms* (more on this later in the chapter) that bring together two market participants who might not otherwise be able to communicate. Uber gives people with cars (perhaps excess capacity - see the Sharing Economy - bring back from Chapter 5) together with people who need a ride. The platform provides a complete one-stop experience for both sides of the transaction, complete with financial fulfillment. The Tech Crunch article (Interested? above) claims that Uber is *not* a low-cost alternative (implying that an Uber ride is at least the same price if not more than a taxi ride) but is disruptive because it provides convenience and speed of delivery which was not possible under the taxi industry's current business model. So Uber brought a new business model. Existing technology (internet, smart devices, GPS, payment systems, cars, drivers and road systems) together in a new way. The taxi industry could have Ubered (Uber is now a verb!) themselves but, for whatever reason (and there are many) they either could or did not. And now they are an industry in trouble except in places where governments have protected the incumbents (those already in the industry). This is not to say that Uber are white knights by any stretch of the imagination. There are serious ethical issues with their business model, including insurance (or lack thereof) for drivers, lack of benefits for employees among others. And when autonomous vehicles become ubiquitous (which the will in the next decade), Uber drivers will be displaced as well. There will be only a few (very few) humans working at and collecting the profits at, Uber. 

Let's examine a list of things that make disruption likely in an industry. 

1.	*Are certain customers of the client subsidising other customers?* For example, are landline subscribers at Bell telephone subsidising cellphone subscribers? If so, someone will step in and disrupt the model by charging customers the real cost of a landline, minus the subsidy. Customers will leave Bell landlines for the cheaper alternative and both landline and cellphone revenues will suffer because Bell would need to charge the real (unsubsidised) cost to cell subscribers as well.  
2.	*Are customers forced to buy a larger package of the firm’s product and service just to get the smaller part that they want?* For example, are customers forced to also buy text and data plans for their smartphone just to get talk, which might be the only thing they want or need? Someone will offer it to them if that’s the case.
3.	*Can customers get what they want, where and when they want it?* For example, can bank customers get access to their accounts from anywhere, or are they forced to go to a branch for certain services such as a mortgage or a loan? Someone will offer a way to supply those services in real time at any location. That’s a disruption. It's serving a market that was previously not served because it wasn't economical. 
4.	*A firm is ripe for disruption if the client doesn’t offer industry standard quality of product or service.* If the client’s product or service is subpar, someone will step in, maybe even supplying the firm’s products to their own customers at a lower price or with quality improvements. 
5.	*If a client’s customers don’t fully use the product or service, resulting in waste and/or paying a higher unit price for what they do use.* If this is the case, someone will package a better fitting product or service, maybe even the client’s own (buying bulk from the client and packaging more appropriately and selling at a favourable unit price). 
6.	*If a client’s customers could themselves become suppliers, the firm is ripe for disruption.* If customers can bundle up what the client provides, combined or not with other products and/or services, and supply themselves and others, the client needs to examine its portfolio. Look at the Sharing Economy as a model.
7.	*If data transparency is low, disruption risk is high.* Firms need to be transparent with customers and offer real-time data exchange. There should be no secrets. A value is a value and must be openly communicated.
8.	*If there are many intermediary fees and process layers and players in the supply chain.* Rest assured that someone will step in and consolidate the layers and reduce the fees and the parties to the transactions, making everything simple and transparent and frictionless for the customer. Witness Fin Tech. 
9.	Like #8 above, *if transactions take a long time to complete*, a firm risks someone stepping in with a simple, efficient system to speed up the process.
10.	*If the client’s product or service can be enriched through providing a data or social media component, then someone will do it.* 
11*.	If the client offers a physical product that is not connected to the internet, but could be by using sensors and the Internet of Things, then someone will do it.* Think thermostats or refrigerators or hot water heaters or furnaces or pens or sticky notes. Anything! 
12.	*Does the client’s product or service require them to physically be present to take possession or to consume the service?* Is there a chance that the transaction can be completed at a distance, from wherever the customer is? If so, someone will do it (groceries, rental cars, driver’s licence, passport, doctor’s visit, etc.). Can the client’s product be turned into a service (think sharing economy models here)?
13.	*Does it take a long time between order and fulfillment?* Must the client’s customers wait a long time for their order to be delivered? Think Amazon, for example. What would happen to their model if it took 4-6 months for the average order of socks, for example, to be delivered? Someone would do it faster.
14.	*Is the client’s value chain suffering from many physical processes and internal hand-offs?* Does it take forever to produce a product and get it to the customer? Is there room for process improvement? Someone will find it. Again, think Amazon here.
15.	*The industry in which your client operates has very high profitability.* Someone will do it cheaper! 
16.	*Does your client charge its customers for information is gathers from them?* Someone will provide it free.
17.	*Is there a dominant platform (such as the Airbnb platform, or the Uber platform) serving the industry?* If not, someone will step in and disrupt the industry right out of its customers. Think of the taxi industry before Uber. Every company had its own proprietary system. Is there the potential to dominate the industry by creating a platform to connect suppliers with customers? If so, someone will do it. 

Amazon is at least *interested* in disrupting a couple of industries (or at least business models) with their interest in floating warehouses:

Many jokes have been made over the years about just which group best exhibits the characteristics of *the artificially intelligent*. Is it politicians? How about referees and judges in sports? A front runner has been academics. We won't settle it here.  Better to concentrate on the growing prowess of machines towards becoming sentient (thinking, aware, conscious entities). 

The blue oval with the cogs and hand indicates that either a machine or a human could take the action. 

(tk) Definition
Wikipedia offers this about AI: 

>"In computer science, an ideal *intelligent machine* is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at an arbitrary goal."

(References in original [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#CITEREFRussellNorvig2003).)

###Machine Learning
(tk) Definition

Wikipedia (yes, again) offers this nugget:

>"Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." This definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms, thus following Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" that the question "Can machines think?" be replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?""

###The Singularity

Way back in 2012, Dilbert predicted the day would come when machines would be intelligent enough (some call this *sentience*) to *create* themselves. Here's what that looked like:

**Figure LJST. Dilbert and the Singularity**
![Dilbert teaches robots to code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/dilbert_singularity.png)

Here's the link to that strip (but there is no context provided by scrolling back and forth in the strip):

Now just short of four years later, Dilbert's creator, Scott Adams, returns Dilbert to his prescient prediction:

To begin, let's establish an excellent resource for looking up the gobbeldygook craziness of technology terminology. Need to know what a particular technology means in (almost) human terms? Check out Gartner's [IT Glossary](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/). Keep this resource close. You'll use it often.

We begin by looking at Gartner Group's Emerging Technology Hype Cycle. The 2014 version was the most recent available at time of writing.

**Figure EC. Gartner's Emerging Technology Hype Cycle**

![Gartner Group Emerging Tech Hype Cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/hype_cycle_2014.png)

Let's unpack the graphic. First of all, the Gartner Group is a large IT consultancy with offices worldwide and a great reputation in the IT consultancy field. Each year, they release research on emerging (up-and-coming) technology, and in a novel way, fit it to a curve of their own design. The curve is both a visual and semantic indicator of the _life_ of a piece of technology from Innovation Trigger (red section on the left of the chart) to Plateau of Productivity (the green section on the far right). [Here](http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/technology-for-innovation-in-marketing/) are some historical ones for reference. 

There are five _phases_ to the cycle. Here's how each is explained by [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) with the my comments in [square parens]:

"Each Hype Cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

"Technology [or Innovation] Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven. [Think of Twitter in the early days. It was cool for sure, but how to make money from it?]

"Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not. [This is the stage at which so-called *wearables* (such as the Apple iWatch) are currently located. They are all cool and people are tripping over themselves to get them, but is there a real future or is it all hype? To frame it in the context of our book here, will they either reduce input requirements or increase outputs? And if they *do* increase output, we need to very carefully examine whether or not the output is actually *valuable*. As an outlandish example, if the output were to include *average hair follicle growth rate*, would that really be *valuable* as opposed to *cool* or *interesting*... We need to metricise the output to determine if it's affording real value. ]

"Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters. [Technology located here is not a failure! It's simple the life cycle stage where all the *hype* has worn off. It's technology in the spot where it will either live or die; if it lives, it moves on to the Slope of Enlightenment" as productive applications are found and exploited.] 

"Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious. [Note that 3D printing technologies are in this phase.]

"Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off." [Here we find stuff such as *speech recognition* and *natural language processing*; things that have made Apple's Siri and Microsoft's new Windows 10 Cortana popular.]  

[[Interested?](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918)]

Let's now take a look at some of the technology plotted on the curve, beginning with tech that Gartner thinks is at least 10 years out. Ten years from now, you will be early in your career and probably looking to move up the ladder. What kind of technology can you expect to be maturing (that is, on the *Plateau of Productivity* end of the curve), if it survives the treacherous middle of the curve mortality that fells so much tech. *Human Augmentation* might be entering the profitable stage. The Bionic Human might become a reality. Super-human athletes and soldiers and police and fire fighters could become a routine part of life. And bio-controlled prosthetics could become commonplace. Amputees will be able to function at a level approaching the performance of the wholly able-bodied. 

And now the Emerging Technology Roadmap.

**Figure KM. Emerging Technology Roadmap.**

![CEB Emerging Tech Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/emerging_tech_roadmap_2014.png)

![CEB Emerging Tech Roadmap 2017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/emerging-technology-roadmap-2014-2017.jpg)

![Value Zone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/value_zone.png)

It's in the Telematics/Usage/Data exhaust box where we are finding a lot of value being generated by what were traditional manufacturers or service providers who now find that their data are as or more valuable than their product/service. Witness Uber, Google, GE and Ford (see the industries tab in OneNote.   

The bait must be tasty to the fish, not the fisher. 

Uber might disrupt parcel delivery (FedEx, UPS, Purolater), pizza and prescription delivery, newspaper distribution, mail delivery and anything else that's on the road. Uber can sell their on-road experience (real time) data to lots of ppl and could probably make a living just being on the road and f the taxi industry shit. What else can they disrupt? Real-time traffic, security patrol (random though), city maintenance surveillance, predictive policing, 

The sharing economy: http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/adapting-to-the-sharing-economy/

There is a difference between "recall" (to bring back from memory; recollect; remember) and "memory" (the mental capacity or faculty of retaining and reviving facts, events, *impressions*, etc., or of recalling or recognizing previous *experiences*; this faculty as possessed by a particular individual; the act or fact of retaining and recalling *impressions*, facts, etc.; remembrance; recollection). ICT does recall. People do memory. Nothing new can possibly be created out of recall. Memory, especially *curated* memory (which is what we do: "to pull together, sift through, and select for presentation, as music or website content") creates new and novel and revolutionary content.  

### The robot piece

This will provide important balance:

Humans Are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines Never Will
Geoff Colvin

Review
“Beautifully written and deeply researched, Humans Are Underrated is one of the most creative and insightful leadership books I have ever read. It is a triumph!”
—DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, Pulitzer Prize–winning historian

“A powerful exposition of the strengths and limitations of technology in shaping our lives and addressing today’s greatest challenges. More than ever, as Colvin demonstrates, we need people who embody the most human of qualities. An uplifting account of the enduring potential of humanity itself.”
—PAUL POLMAN, CEO, Unilever

“As machines inexorably become ever more competent at doing machinelike things, interpersonal skills, irreplaceable skills of human interaction, will come to be recognized as being even more valuable than they’ve always been. This is an extremely important, highly practical, and indeed exhilarating book.”
—SIR MARTIN SORRELL, CEO, WPP

“Through a series of practical case studies and insights, Colvin clearly demonstrates that—regardless of where the future takes us—emotional intelligence will remain one of the most valuable human skills and the Human Element will remain a differentiator.” 
—ANDREW N. LIVERIS, chairman and CEO, Dow Chemical Company

“Geoff Colvin’s fresh take on how to respond to the rise of brilliant machines and the changing nature of work is as wise as it is inspiring.”
—DOMINIC BARTON, global managing director, McKinsey & Company

“Corporate leaders often say, ‘People come first.’ True innovation is realized only when their actions match their words.” 
—ROBERT GREIFELD, CEO, Nasdaq

Product Description
As technology races ahead, what will people do better than computers?

What hope will there be for us when computers can drive cars better than humans, predict Supreme Court decisions better than legal experts, identify faces, scurry helpfully around offices and factories, even perform some surgeries, all faster, more reliably, and less expensively than people?

It’s easy to imagine a nightmare scenario in which computers simply take over most of the tasks that people now get paid to do. While we’ll still need high-level decision makers and computer developers, those tasks won’t keep most working-age people employed or allow their living standard to rise. The unavoidable question—will millions of people lose out, unable to best the machine?—is increasingly dominating business, education, economics, and policy.

The bestselling author of Talent Is Overrated explains how the skills the economy values are changing in historic ways. The abilities that will prove most essential to our success are no longer the technical, classroom-taught left-brain skills that economic advances have demanded from workers in the past. Instead, our greatest advantage lies in what we humans are most powerfully driven to do for and with one another, arising from our deepest, most essentially human abilities—empathy, creativity, social sensitivity, storytelling, humor, building relationships, and expressing ourselves with greater power than logic can ever achieve. This is how we create durable value that is not easily replicated by technology — because we’re hardwired to want it from humans.

These high-value skills create tremendous competitive advantage — more devoted customers, stronger cultures, breakthrough ideas, and more effective teams. And while many of us regard these abilities as innate traits — “he’s a real people person,” “she’s naturally creative” — it turns out they can all be developed. They're already being developed in a range of far-sighted organizations, such as:

• the Cleveland Clinic, which emphasizes empathy training of doctors and all employees to improve patient outcomes and lower medical costs; 
• the U.S. Army, which has revolutionized its training to focus on human interaction, leading to stronger teams and greater success in real-world missions;
• Stanford Business School, which has overhauled its curriculum to teach interpersonal skills through human-to-human experiences.

As technology advances, we shouldn't focus on beating computers at what they do — we’ll lose that contest. Instead, we must develop our most essential human abilities and teach our kids to value not just technology but also the richness of interpersonal experience. They will be the most valuable people in our world because of it. Colvin proves that to a far greater degree than most of us ever imagined, we already have what it takes to be great.

###Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

**Figure ERT. Wally goes all AI**

![AI & machine learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/ai_dilbert.png)

Source: The Dilbert cartoon above is available [here](http://bit.ly/28JMLOk).

There are a couple of interesting things going on in the Dilbert strip above. First, the notion of a *minimum viable product*. This perversion of several design standards is hilarious to anyone in the design industry, whether software, hardware or just everyday product design. The goals of simplicity and elegance in design, recyclability and multi-purposing are all nicely met by a block of wood. Trouble is, the block has severely limited capacity to do anything. That never stopped a good engineer though ;) Next, the notion of AI or *artificial intelligence*, is a really hot topic these days. We will consider it in some depth below. Finally, the strip plays on our fears that machines are becoming too human or worse still, *better than human*. Many fear the inevitability of *the singularity*. We will touch on that as well in this chapter. 

### Machine Learning

Traditionally, the only way to get a computer to do something— from adding two numbers to flying an airplane — was to write down an algorithm explaining how, in painstaking detail. But machine-learning algorithms, also known as learners, are different: they figure it out on their own, by making inferences from data. And the more data they have, the better they get. Now we don’t have to program computers; they program themselves.
