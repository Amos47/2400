### Measurement
<a name="measurement"></a>
We first need to carefully consider what is meant by the term *measurement* as measurement is necessary in order for data to be useful. Measurement makes data tangible and gives it value. Under the topic of *Accuracy and precision*, Wikipedia (accessed June 17, 2015) offers the following discussion seedlings:

#### Accuracy
“In the fields of science, engineering, industry, and statistics, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's actual (true) value."

#### Precision
"The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method."

They continue that, “A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision."

Furthermore, “A measurement system is considered valid if it is both accurate and precise. Related terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability).

#### Another view
According to ISO 5725-1, Accuracy consists of Trueness (proximity of measurement results to the true value) and Precision (repeatability or reproducibility of the measurement). Furthermore, the terms *trueness* and *precision* are both used to describe the accuracy of a measurement. Trueness refers to the closeness of the mean of the measurement results to the actual (true) value and precision refers to the closeness of agreement within individual results. Therefore, according to the ISO standard, the term "accuracy" refers to both trueness and precision.

Looking at the *target practice* image above, we immediately see that no one shot is exactly dead centre. This is to be expected and might even be considered a random outcome. It's pretty hard to hit dead centre on any attempt. So we can't give any of these attempts good marks for *precision* - the degree to which they hit the centre of the target. But all is not lost. We next observe that the four attempts are, in general, at about the same distance from dead centre. So none is a great shot, but considered together, they seem to have some consistency. So while not completely accurate, they are at least *true to each other*. This gives them marks for *trueness*. They err by the same amount in different directions. So, *on average*, a good set of results, though no one was accurate. For why this is important, see the *old joke* below.

Here we have a different situation. While again not even one attempt was dead centre, all four were clustered closely to the left and below the *pay dirt* area. Still a situation of *low accuracy* but not for the same reason as above. In this case, the *precision* is excellent. The attempts are very closely clustered together and are thus very precise. But they are *consistently* wrong. As if some technical difficulty is introducing bias into the process (a crooked site perhaps?) causing an otherwise great set of attempts to be consistently wrong. But unlike the first low accuracy situation we looked at above, the attempts are not considered to be *true* on the whole. This is because their *average* distance from dead centre is considered to be large. 

Note in the first case above if you were to calculate an average difference from the centre, you would note that they are all at least touching the first outer ring of the target (though it is enticing to note, it doesn't matter that they are nearly at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions). Calculating an average distance for all four would yield a mean very close to 1 (one) if we were calibrating the rings as 1, 2, 3, etc.  

Now consider the second case. All are clustered in one spot AND two of the attempts are clearly farther away than any in the first example. The average difference would, therefore, be greater. It appears to be splitting hairs, but it's the best I've got. I'll try to photo some of my own for the next edition of this text.

This might clear up some of the confusion: "According to ISO 5725-1, the general term *accuracy* is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same *measurand* [see this reference to understand the term *measurand*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measurand), it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case *trueness* is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value and *precision* is the closeness of agreement among a set of results."

Figure SR might help in that it clearly shows precision as being *how close a measure is to the true value* whereas trueness is how closely each measure in a set of measures agrees with the others. And maybe it doesn't help. I'm doing my best. I'm sure you will LMK if you don't get this.   

The Wikipedia article continues that, “The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data. In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement. In numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.”

Each of these will become important at different junctures in our study. Measurement resolution will appear again when we discuss *sensors* and resolution of representation when we talk about the shrinking divide between *digital and binary*.

#### An old joke
*All this measurement talk reminds me of the great old joke about a doctor, a lawyer and a statistician who are obviously starving or else they wouldn't be on a hunting trip. While hiding in the bushes, they spot a big buck deer at a distance of 25 metres directly in front of them. The doctor sizes up the distance and wind speed, then aims and fires an arrow at the deer. His shot zooms one metre to the rear of the unsuspecting creature. The lawyer notes the doctor's outcome, does some quick calculations, then aims and fires. His shot zips one metre in front of the deer. Our statistician friend jumps up, raises his hands in victory and shouts "GOT ‘IM!!"  (No animals were hurt in the process of creating this book.)*
