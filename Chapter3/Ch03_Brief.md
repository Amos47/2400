##Chapter 3 - Brief ![Brief](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/icons/32/suitcase_7.png)

### In which we consider ICT as a product

In this chapter we consider the broad topic of how systems come to be. What sparks the need for a system or a system change? How and who makes the decisions on what systems get commissioned? How are system requirements decided? How are systems built? How are they put into place in an organisation? How are they cared for during their life-span and how are they retired?  

This chapter is about more than building new systems. It is also about NOT building a system when a new system is required, but rather acquiring it through other channels. And it's about how organisations decide whether to buy, build, rent or commission the building of a brand-new system.
