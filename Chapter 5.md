We begin by looking at Gartner Group's Emerging Technology Hype Cycle.

Let's unpack the graphic. First of all, the Gartner Group is a large IT consultancy with offices worldwide and a great reputation in the IT consultancy field. Each year, they release research on emerging (up-and-coming) technology, and in a novel way, fit it to a curve of their own design. The curve is both a visual and semantic indicator of the _life_ of a piece of technology from Innovation Trigger (red section on the left of the chart) to Plateau of Productivity (the green section on the far right). [Here](http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/technology-for-innovation-in-marketing/) are some historical ones for reference. 

There are five _phases_ to the cycle. Here's how each is explained by [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp):

"Each Hype Cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

"[Innovation] Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven. [Think of Twitter in the early days. It was cool for sure, but how to make money from it?]

"Peak of Inflated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of success stories â€” often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not. [Think of MP3 players.]

"Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters. 

"Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.

"Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off."

And now the Emerging Technology Roadmap.
