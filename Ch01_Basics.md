## Pillar 1: Are we talking data, information or knowledge?

### What are data, information and knowledge?

Much of this preliminary section relies on work from a dated but still quite interesting article from *liquidinformation.org*. While quite compelling and thought-provoking, I don't agree with everything written there, but I was certainly stimulated by the piece.

[Interested?](http://www.liquidinformation.org/information_history.html)

First of all, many of the times the author refers to *information*, I contend they are instead referring to *data*. This distinction will become more clear as we progress. Here is a quote from the piece: 

“The first information was incidental. A cratered moon records the history of the impacts [of interstellar objects] but it does so by accident, as a by-product of the events, not *for* the events.” [*emphasis* added]

From that point on, we have, as a species, become all about communication. There is almost nothing that we do that does not involve information and communication. The technology piece came later, but provides the impetus for our study. While I am quoting slightly out of order, the same article also offers:

“Information’s natural state used to be one of motion, of activity. Information is generated by interactions, information *is* interaction, as without comparison, without a *context* [much more on *context* in the second chapter of this text], without interaction, there is nothing. There is no temperature with only hot. There is no darkness without light [...] Information cannot exist without *context*. And [...] it is important to point out that information has to be useful to exist. [...] Useful in a specific *context*. If it is not, it either does not exist, or it becomes negatively useful. As in noise.”

So only something that is *useful* can be called information. Now that's a bold statement. Our task then becomes to discover what *useful* means. I will argue that useful has to do with either causing change or persisting the *status quo*. Decision and action cause either change or persistence (the absence of change when change *could* occur). Please stay for the show. 

Right up front let's get clear on something. **Wikipedia cannot be used to do science any more than an encyclopaedia or my mother's grand Irish sayings.** My use of Wikipedia in this book is to encourage thoughtful discussion and not to provide any kind of proof; you will always get my interpretation of the issue at hand and often get other sources with which to augment or compare. Such is academics. 

That said, Wikipedia has this to say on the topic: 

In the context of information as: ”... an influence which leads to a transformation.” It can be seen as “... any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns. In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example, DNA. The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind.”

I have a couple of comments on these web musings. To begin, the assertion regarding *influence* is closest to what I will show is most important in the context of business. Information leads to decisions which have consequences. It is the consequences of decisions that produce knowledge and inform the future. I would, however, maintain that the DNA example is flawed in that DNA is *deterministic*. There is no *interpretation* necessary in order for DNA to have an impact. It requires no *context* in which information is created. It expresses what it is destined to express with no need for any understanding or translation. It cannot do other than it was destined to do. DNA's actions are determined *a priori* (before the fact) and in this sense DNA is *data*, as I will show later, and not *information.*

The Wikipedia article goes on that “If, however, the premise of 'influence' implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge.” This is where you and I come in. We are the interpreters. The article continues that “Complex definitions of both 'information' and 'knowledge' make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of 'transformation' is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge.”

No need to fully digest of understand this just yet. We will spend some time on such transformation and why it’s important for business. 

The article maintains that: “In this practice, tools and processes are used to assist a knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions, including steps such as [my comments in parens]:

- Reviewing information in order to effectively derive value and meaning [assessing the outcomes of decisions]
- Referencing metadata if any is available [metadata is literally *data about data* - the list of numbers you've called on your cell is metadata]
- Establishing a relevant context, often selecting from many possible contexts [this will be important for us]
- Deriving new knowledge from the information [critical in the business context]
- Making decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge [the feedback from previous knowledge acquisition – this is how knowledge grows]

“Stewart (2001) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one, lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise.”

Well you can't get any more impactful that that. Knowledge creation from information is at the very core of what makes business successful.

### The data, information and knowledge hierarchy
To begin, when studying Information Systems (or the broader term that I prefer - *Information and Communication Technology* or *ICT*), it is crucial to define what we mean by the pieces. We need to carefully specify the differences between the **Big Three** of *data, information* and *knowledge*. We need also to examine the intimate interrelationships between these levels of the hierarchy in order to understand what ICT really is and what impact it has on our private and public lives.

Let's first deal with a potential controversy. You might have heard (more likely you will hear or see in other places during your academic career) this hierarchy referred to as the Data, Information, Knowledge and *Wisdom* hierarchy. There are problems with this particular characterisation (see the Interested? link below] so instead, I describe here the simpler *Data, Information and Knowledge* hierarchy. 

[Interested?](https://hbr.org/2010/02/data-is-to-info-as-info-is-not)

### Back to the Big Three
With all the measurement issues behind us, we now need to carefully define what each of *data*, *information* and *knowledge* means in its own right. We can then examine the hierarchy that evolves when discussing these big three in the context of decision making. Oh yes, and *context* will be critical too. We will deal with that in some detail in Chapter 2.

### Data

**Figure STT. Definition of data from Visual Thesaurus**

![visualthesaurus.com Definition of data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/vt_data.PNG)

The excellent website (or service, really) [visualthesaurus.com](http://visualthesaurus.com) shows the visualisation, above, of the look-up term *data* once expanded by clicking on the red node.  

The interpretation of the visual goes as follows:

* A solid line between two terms denotes a relationship between a meaning and a word. Thus the term at the distal (far) end of a solid line can be used to express the meaning of the defined word. Thus in this image, data and information can be used to describe each other (are synonomous). This will be discussed at length below. I maintain that, while they are often interchangeable in common usage, they are not equivalent terms. Stay tuned.
* A dashed line indicates a *type of* relationship. Thus the term at the distal end of a dashed line indicates that this construct is a type of the term at the proximal (near) end of the dashed line. So *accounting data* is a *type of* data. Self-evident, really. 
* A dashed red line (not shown in this visual but appearing in others below) indicates an opposite. So a red line appearing between the terms *distal* and *proximal* would indicate that they are a negation of each other. 

The Visual Thesaurus defines data as: "A collection of facts from which conclusions may be drawn." Hold onto this definition as we further analyse the complex relationship between data and information.

The visual on *data* above implies (states, really) that data and information are synonymous; that they can be used to describe each other, and thus that they are equal. My definition, which clears up some of the ambiguity in the terms *data* and *information*, is: 

*Data is pre-information*. It is potential information; a collection of one or more facts, figures or measurements of some entity whether tangible or not. *Information*, on the other hand, is *actionable data*; data embedded in a *context* that allows us to make a decision on a course of action. 

We have already considered *measurement* in some depth [(take me there)](#measurement) and we will spend some time unpacking the concepts of *entities* and *tangible/intangible* in due course. 

The online [Business Dictionary](http://businessdictionary.com) defines data as:

1. "Information in raw or unorganized form (such as alphabets, numbers, or symbols) that refer to, or represent, conditions, ideas, or objects. Data is limitless and present everywhere in the universe. See also information and knowledge.", and
2. "Computers: Symbols or signals that are input, stored, and processed by a computer, for output as usable information.”

I would clarify the first definition by stating that data are *potential information* when in raw form. We cannot define data as information and information as data. In my opinion, both definitions should begin with the words in the second definition, specifically that data are *symbols and signals* or indeed drawings or sounds or signs or even facial expressions that carry within them the *potential* for information but not information *per se*. Data is raw and lacks context. A column of digits in a spreadsheet with no row header to indicate what the data *mean*, for example, is not information. It has no potential impact. I maintain that information occurs in the *interpretation* of data when it’s *located in context*. Read on.

Note the definition of information below in the section on Information, from the same source, and note that one of the necessary elements of information is that it be presented within a context that gives it meaning. Thus the dictionary contradicts itself in this case. Good thing we're watching carefully... ;)

#### Synopsis

Data is not information, and neither is information, data. Data represents, at best, *potential* information, if it is measured with care. Data scientists and Information Designers pay close attention to how data are measured in order that maximal value can be extracted from business analytics efforts.

We now more on to a discussion of what information is. This is where it gets good.

### Information

**Figure LP. Definition of information from Visual Thesaurus**

![visualthesaurus.com Definition of information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/vt_info.PNG)

The Visual Thesaurus defines *information*, in conjunction with the visual above and ignoring the definitions pertaining strictly to the study or administration of justice and the law (with apologies to LJ), as:

1.	A message received and understood [YES]
2.	Knowledge acquired through study or experience or instruction [YES]
3.	A collection of facts from which conclusions may be drawn [PROBABLY]
4.	The psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning [YES]
5.	In communication theory, a numerical measure of the uncertainty of an outcome [MAYBE] 

We need some unpacking here. In the [square brackets] at the end of each definition of information above, I have added my little editorial comment. Information can *clearly* be characterised as *received and understood* as understanding assumes that not only the content but also the context of the message, it's meaning and its intent have all been synthesised. If something is *understood* then the *context* is rich enough to allow a decision to be made based on the *content*. Data alone cannot do this. It should be noted that it is entirely possible that the *wrong* decision can still be made. Inadequate or poorly measured data might result in an incomplete context. A faulty message receiver (as in any of us if we've had one too many) can equally result in a bad decision being made. The distinction here is not between good and bad decisions, *per se*, but rather between whether a decision can be made at all. 

The second and fourth definitions are acceptable, on the whole, especially, as we will see, as they relate to *experience and learning from experience*. More to come on this.

The third definition is shading into murky territory. A collection of facts, in and of itself, cannot afford a conclusion. That is the domain of information. The facts might well form a context from which information can arise, but alone, no. Thus number three is not precise enough. 

The fifth definition, as it applies to *entropy*, is dealt with in detail in Chapter 2.  

Our business dictionary source offers that *information* (not data but information) is:

"Data that is:  

1. accurate and timely, 
2. specific and organized for a purpose, 
3. presented within a context that gives it meaning and relevance, and 
4. can lead to an increase in understanding and decrease in uncertainty."

They go on to offer that “Information is valuable because it can affect behaviour, a decision, or an outcome. For example, if a manager is told his/her company's net profit decreased in the past month, he/she may use this information as a reason to cut financial spending for the next month. A piece of information is considered valueless if, after receiving it, things remain unchanged. For a technical definition of information see information theory."

I must respectfully disagree with several of the assertions in this definition. Specifically, they again define *data* as *information*. The two are clearly not synonymous. To begin the definition of information with the assertion that it is *data* is clearly not helpful for us. Furthermore, data doesn't have the potential to change things (or to lead to change). Only information can lead to change through informing our decisions. But what is bang on about this definition is its assertion that information *can affect behaviour, decision making and outcomes*. This is to where we are going here. 

[Interested in Information Theory?](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/information-theory.html)

Let’s be clear: **Data that can be measured and put into context leads to information, which facilitates decision making.** Moreover, **data and information are not the same thing.** We will look at the distinction in some detail in Chapter 2. 

Finally, it is categorically *not* necessary for information to lead to change. Information leads to decisions, which are binary by nature. One of the two possibilities when informed about something is the decision *to do nothing!* And that’s perfectly fine. Maybe that’s the right decision. *Ergo* information does not always result in change. But it always results in the *potential* for change. 

Now we're getting somewhere.

Let's move on to knowledge. 

### Knowledge

**Figure KS. Definition of knowledge (know) from Visual Thesaurus**

![visualthesaurus.com Definition of know](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertriordan/2400/master/Images/vt_know.PNG)

The [Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/ "Visual Thesaurus") cogently defines *know* (a richer context is provided than if we asked for a definition of knowledge) as: "The psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning." So this definition explicitly excludes machines from having the capacity to *know something* since it refers to a "psychological result." Pity...  

But let's look at this visual for a second. Note how rich it is. Note how many nodes are of interest to us here. 

Next let's look at what our Business Dictionary source offers for the definition of *knowledge*. Their general definition fits our needs:

"Human faculty resulting from interpreted information; understanding that germinates from [the] combination of data, information, experience, and individual interpretation. Variously defined as, "Things that are held to be true in a given context and that drive us to action if there were no impediments" (Andre Boudreau). "Capacity to act" (Karl Sweiby). "Justified true belief that increases an entity's capacity for effective action" (Nonaka and Takeuchi). "The perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas" (John Locke). In an organizational context, knowledge is the sum of what is known and resides in the intelligence and the competence of people. In recent years, knowledge has come to be recognized as a factor of production (see knowledge capital) in its own right, and distinct from labor."

[Interested?](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/knowledge.html)

Some very rich definition and context here. From this we can glean that *data is useless unless in a context*, which allows it to become information. Information drives decisions and decisions drive action or inaction, in the rich context of previous information. Collected information from this action, previous actions and from all other sources of knowledge becomes new or evolving knowledge and confers the ability to pass judgment on the previous three. 

Again, we consider these important concepts in detail in Chapter 2. 

#### Important takeaways

- Measurement is complex, critical and has several quality metrics associated with it
- Data and information are not synonymous 
- Information is created in the presence of data in context
- Decisions arise from information and a decision to *not* act is as valid as one *to act*
- Knowledge arises from accumulated experience with the outcomes of decisions 

### Communication

Communication is the essence of our being. Communication is almost all we do. Our friends at Wikipedia have this to say about that: "Communication (from Latin commūnicāre, meaning 'to share') is the activity of conveying meaning through a shared system of signs and semiotic rules." 

[Interested?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)

Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols in communication. 

[Interested?](http://www.amazon.ca/This-Means-That-Users-Semiotics/dp/1856697355/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1427474025&sr=8-4&keywords=semiotics)

We can further examine a subset of what [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/communication) offers:

1. The act or process of communicating; fact of being communicated. 
2. The imparting or interchange of thoughts, opinions, or information by speech, writing, or signs. 
3. Something imparted, interchanged, or transmitted. 
4. A document or message imparting news, views, information, etc. 
6. Communications - means of sending messages, orders, etc., including telephone, telegraph, radio, and television. 
7. Biology: a) activity by one organism that changes or has the potential to change the behavior of other organisms; b) transfer of information from one cell or molecule to another, as by chemical or electrical signals.

Now isn't that interesting, the Biology part? That's exactly what we are saying about *Information*. Specifically that we (or at least I) have here defined information (that it emerges from data in a context) as something that is communicated and can cause *change*. So in nature, a large part of communication involves change, and such communication is achieved by the exchange of *information*. Indeed a website article we will examine in depth in Chapter 2 on *Liquid Information* offers on the [history of information]((http://www.liquidinformation.org/information_history.html) that as life appeared on earth it required “[...] storing information about how to replicate something, how to replicate itself. Information now served a purpose...”. Life requires information because life requires action to perpetuate itself. The purpose of life is perpetuation. 

Thus communication allows humans to fulfil their only real purpose on this planet: to remain on this planet. Too contentious for a business course in ICT? Expand your horizons. Read lots. Think lots. Then we can talk.  

How pervasive is information communication? What's the *coverage* in Canada? Take a look at this simple interactive map:
