## Pillar 1: Are we talking data, information or knowledge?

### What are data, information and knowledge?

Much of this preliminary section relies on work from a dated but still quite interesting article from *liquidinformation.org*. While quite compelling and thought-provoking, I don't agree with everything written there, but I was certainly stimulated by the piece.

[Interested?](http://www.liquidinformation.org/information_history.html)

First of all, many of the times the author refers to *information*, I contend they are instead referring to *data*. This distinction will become more clear as we progress. Here is a quote from the piece: 

“The first information was incidental. A cratered moon records the history of the impacts [of interstellar objects] but it does so by accident, as a by-product of the events, not *for* the events.” [*emphasis* added]

From that point on, we have, as a species, become all about communication. There is almost nothing that we do that does not involve information and communication. The technology piece came later, but provides the impetus for our study. While I am quoting slightly out of order, the same article also offers:

“Information’s natural state used to be one of motion, of activity. Information is generated by interactions, information *is* interaction, as without comparison, without a *context* [much more on *context* in the second chapter of this text], without interaction, there is nothing. There is no temperature with only hot. There is no darkness without light [...] Information cannot exist without *context*. And [...] it is important to point out that information has to be useful to exist. [...] Useful in a specific *context*. If it is not, it either does not exist, or it becomes negatively useful. As in noise.”

So only something that is *useful* can be called information. Now that's a bold statement. Our task then becomes to discover what *useful* means. I will argue that useful has to do with either causing change or persisting the *status quo*. Decision and action cause either change or persistence (the absence of change when change *could* occur). Please stay for the show. 

Right up front let's get clear on something. **Wikipedia cannot be used to do science any more than an encyclopaedia or my mother's grand Irish sayings.** My use of Wikipedia in this book is to encourage thoughtful discussion and not to provide any kind of proof; you will always get my interpretation of the issue at hand and often get other sources with which to augment or compare. Such is academics. 

That said, Wikipedia has this to say on the topic: 

In the context of information as: ”... an influence which leads to a transformation.” It can be seen as “... any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns. In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern. Consider, for example, DNA. The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind.”

I have a couple of comments on these web musings. To begin, the assertion regarding *influence* is closest to what I will show is most important in the context of business. Information leads to decisions which have consequences. It is the consequences of decisions that produce knowledge and inform the future. I would, however, maintain that the DNA example is flawed in that DNA is *deterministic*. There is no *interpretation* necessary in order for DNA to have an impact. It requires no *context* in which information is created. It expresses what it is destined to express with no need for any understanding or translation. It cannot do other than it was destined to do. DNA's actions are determined *a priori* (before the fact) and in this sense DNA is *data*, as I will show later, and not *information.*

The Wikipedia article goes on that “If, however, the premise of 'influence' implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge.” This is where you and I come in. We are the interpreters. The article continues that “Complex definitions of both 'information' and 'knowledge' make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of 'transformation' is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge.”

No need to fully digest of understand this just yet. We will spend some time on such transformation and why it’s important for business. 

The article maintains that: “In this practice, tools and processes are used to assist a knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions, including steps such as [my comments in parens]:

- Reviewing information in order to effectively derive value and meaning [assessing the outcomes of decisions]
- Referencing metadata if any is available [metadata is literally *data about data* - the list of numbers you've called on your cell is metadata]
- Establishing a relevant context, often selecting from many possible contexts [this will be important for us]
- Deriving new knowledge from the information [critical in the business context]
- Making decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledge [the feedback from previous knowledge acquisition – this is how knowledge grows]

“Stewart (2001) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one, lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise.”

Well you can't get any more impactful that that. Knowledge creation from information is at the very core of what makes business successful.

### The data, information and knowledge hierarchy
To begin, when studying Information Systems (or the broader term that I prefer - *Information and Communication Technology* or *ICT*), it is crucial to define what we mean by the pieces. We need to carefully specify the differences between the **Big Three** of *data, information* and *knowledge*. We need also to examine the intimate interrelationships between these levels of the hierarchy in order to understand what ICT really is and what impact it has on our private and public lives.

Let's first deal with a potential controversy. You might have heard (more likely you will hear or see in other places during your academic career) this hierarchy referred to as the Data, Information, Knowledge and *Wisdom* hierarchy. There are problems with this particular characterisation (see the Interested? link below] so instead, I describe here the simpler *Data, Information and Knowledge* hierarchy.
